What is the role of ‘filth flies’ in the spread of antimicrobial resistance?,fact,1,10,0.7,0.3,"'Filth flies' play a significant role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by acting as vectors that transmit enteric pathogens to humans and animals. These flies feed and develop in excrement and decaying matter, environments rich in high concentrations of bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant strains. They are known to pick up resistant bacteria, which often share the same genotypes as those found in humans and animals in overlapping habitats. Specifically, these flies are associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, carbapenemase-producing, and colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) bacteria. 

The transmission risk is particularly high for enteric bacteria due to their prevalence in excrement, which flies may contact. Moreover, flies can 'bio-enhance' the transmission of AMR by allowing bacteria to multiply in their digestive tract, mouthparts, and regurgitation spots. Quantitative risk assessment models focusing on the medical significance of AMR in flies could benefit from additional data on vectorial capacity and colonization dose. This highlights the need for targeted ecological, epidemiological, and experimental studies to better understand and mitigate this risk (Source: Readable abstracts.pdf).","Accuracy: 95 - The response accurately describes the role of 'filth flies' as vectors in spreading antimicrobial resistance, which is well-supported by the context provided.
