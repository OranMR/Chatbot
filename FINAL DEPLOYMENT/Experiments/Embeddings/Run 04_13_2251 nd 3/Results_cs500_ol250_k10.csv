Furthermore, analyzing carbapenem and vancomycin resistance separately indicated that counts of ARGs to these antimicrobials were positively associated with their increased usage [carbapenem rate ratio (RR) 1.91, 95% CI 1.01– 3.72, p =0.07, and vancomycin RR 10.25, CI 2.32–49.10, p &amp;lt;0.01].",0.6632356643676758,0.5666666666666667,0.6388888888888888,True,False,False,True
