How is Uganda trying to monitor antibiotic resistance?,This article examines efforts and progress in developing and implementing a human health antimicrobial resistance surveillance strategy in Uganda.,nt strategies that track the changing trends in antibiotic resistance levels to tackle this problem. This article examines efforts and progress in developing and implementing a human health antimicrobial resistance surveillance strategy in Uganda. We do so within the context of the National Action Plan for tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR-NAP) launched in 2018. We discuss the technical milestones and progress in implementing surveillance of GLASS priority pathogens under this framework.,0.6962000131607056,0.45412130637636083,0.5,True,True,True,True

Given the clinical and public health implications of AMR, Pakistan must prioritize its policies in PC settings.

How do UK farm vets view diagnostic tests in managing antibiotic use?,The findings identify a considerable ambivalence on the part of farm animal veterinarians regarding the current and future uses of rapid and point-of-care diagnostic tests as a means of improving clinical diagnosis and addressing inappropriate antibiotic medicine use.,"ivestock veterinarians’ perceptions and practices https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.105822 ""Background This paper explores the current role and place of diagnostic tests in the treatment of farm animal disease. With the growing focus on reduced reliance on antibiotic medicines in both animal and human patient care, attention is increasingly being focused on the practice, the technology and the function of diagnostic tests and how these can support responsible antimicrobial use.",0.768477737903595,0.7052631578947368,0.7792207792207793,True,False,False,True
How might epigenetic changes contribute to antimicrobial resistance?,"Since the discovery of antibiotics, humans have been benefiting from them by decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial infections.","mical changes in the bacteria, the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance are not under control. Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival.",0.7719326019287109,0.4638655462184874,0.5588235294117647,True,False,False,True
