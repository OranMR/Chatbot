Method This paper reports the findings of a recent large-scale online survey of UK farm animal veterinarians (n=153) which investigated current veterinary diagnostic practice with particular attention to the relationship between diagnostic test use and antibiotic treatment.,0.7850528955459595,0.7253044654939107,0.810810810810811,True,False,False,True
How might epigenetic changes contribute to antimicrobial resistance?,"Since the discovery of antibiotics, humans have been benefiting from them by decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial infections.","mical changes in the bacteria, the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance are not under control. Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival.",0.7364529371261597,0.44805194805194803,0.5428571428571428,True,False,True,True
What is the title of the study concerning masuring AMR in untreated sewage?,Global monitoring of antimicrobial resistance based on metagenomics analyses of urban sewagehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08853-3,"""Antimicrobial Global monitoring of antimicrobial resistance based on metagenomics analyses of urban sewage https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08853-3 resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, but obtaining representative data on AMR for healthy human populations is difficult. Here, we use metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in 60 countries.",0.625079870223999,0.48201438848920863,0.3448275862068965,True,True,True,True
