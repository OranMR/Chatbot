Given the clinical and public health implications of AMR, Pakistan must prioritize its policies in PC settings. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) need to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and dispensing, improve their understanding of the AWaRe (access, watch and reserve antibiotics) classification and guidance, monitor current usage and resistance trends, as well as implement antimicrobial stewardship (ASP)",0.6856844425201416,0.5493421052631579,0.5882352941176471,True,False,True,True
How do UK farm vets view diagnostic tests in managing antibiotic use?,The findings identify a considerable ambivalence on the part of farm animal veterinarians regarding the current and future uses of rapid and point-of-care diagnostic tests as a means of improving clinical diagnosis and addressing inappropriate antibiotic medicine use.,ingly seeking to make diagnostic tests mandatory before the use of critically important antibiotics. Method This paper reports the findings of a recent large-scale online survey of UK farm animal veterinarians (n=153) which investigated current veterinary diagnostic practice with particular attention to the relationship between diagnostic test use and antibiotic treatment.,0.7850528955459595,0.3776932826362484,0.6097560975609755,True,False,True,True
How might epigenetic changes contribute to antimicrobial resistance?,"Since the discovery of antibiotics, humans have been benefiting from them by decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial infections."," the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival. In this review article, epigenetic changes leading to the development of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria are discussed.",0.7435103058815002,0.4440894568690096,0.5507246376811594,True,False,False,True
