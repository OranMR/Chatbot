However, there was a small positive association between resistance genes and antimicrobial usage matched to ARG phenotype (IRR 1.11, CI 1.06 - 1.16, P &lt;0.001). Furthermore, analysing carbapenem and vancomycin resistance separately indicated that counts of ARGs to these antimicrobials were positively associated with their increased usage (carbapenem rate ratio (RR) 1.91, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.01 –",0.6548652648925781,0.0584144645340751,0.4235294117647059,True,False,False,True
