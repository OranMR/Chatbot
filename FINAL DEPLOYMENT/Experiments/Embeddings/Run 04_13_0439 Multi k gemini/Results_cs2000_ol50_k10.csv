What evidence supports the two-way traffic of AMR between farms and clinics?,Whole genome sequencing is revealing and beginning to quantify the two-way traffic of AMR bacteria between the farm and the clinic,"n advance of incontrovertible evidence for change. ""Abstract Antimicrobial In this paper we engage with the role of market actors in the precautionary regulation of farming practices and AMR threats. The paper takes the UK poultry sector as exemplary of an audit-led process that has, in recent years, achieved impressive reductions in antimicrobial use. Using qualitative interview data with farmers and veterinarians we chart the changing practices that have accompanied this reduction in treatments. We use this analysis to raise some cautions around audit-led systems of regulation. Audits can lock farms and animals into particular versions of farming and animal health; they can elevate harmful compensatory practices (including disinfectant uses); and they can reproduce an actuarial approach to an issue that does not fit the conventions of risk management. The paper presents the considerable successes that have been achieved over a short period of time in a livestock sector, while generating notes of caution concerning the audit-led management of livestock-related AMR threats.""

Considering these characteristics, ‘filth flies’ are potential vectors for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This review defines the role of flies in the spread of AMR and identifies knowledge gaps. The literature search (original articles, reviews indexed for PubMed) was restricted to the English language. References of identified studies were screened for additional sources. ‘Filth flies’ are colonized with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of clinical relevance. This includes extended spectrum beta-lactamase-, carbapenemase- producing and colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) bacteria. Resistant bacteria in flies often share the same genotypes with bacteria from humans and animals when their habitat overlap. The risk of transmission is most likely highest for enteric bacteria as they are shed in high concentration in excrements and are easily picked up by flies. ‘Filth flies’ can ‘bio-enhance’ the transmission of AMR as bacteria multiply in the digestive tract, mouthparts and regurgitation spots. To better understand the medical importance of AMR in flies, quantitative risk assessment models should be refined and fed with additional data (e.g. vectorial capacity, colonization dose).

How does a high-concentrate diet affect antimicrobial resistance genes in cattle?,Both the diversity and abundance of these genes were higher in concentrate-fed animals.,"contribution of animal production to this problem. Here, the influence of diet on the ruminal resistome and abundance of pathogenicity genes was assessed in ruminal digesta samples taken from 50 antibiotic-free beef cattle, comprising four cattle breeds receiving two diets containing different proportions of concentrate. Two hundred and four genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR), colonisation, communication or pathogenicity functions were identified from 4966 metagenomic genes using KEGG identification. Both the diversity and abundance of these genes were higher in concentrate-fed animals. Chloramphenicol and microcin resistance genes were dominant in samples from forage-fed animals (P < 0.001), while aminoglycoside and streptomycin resistances were enriched in concentrate-fed animals. The concentrate-based diet also increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, which includes many animal and zoonotic pathogens. A high ratio of Proteobacteria to (Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes) was confirmed as a good indicator for rumen dysbiosis, with eight cases all from concentrate-fed animals.

In this study, clinically relevant bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 3D bioprinted using a double-crosslinked alginate bioink to form mature bacteria biofilms, characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescent staining. Solid and porous bacteria-laden constructs were reproducibly bioprinted with thicknesses ranging from 0.25 to 4 mm. We demonstrated 3D bioprinting of thicker biofilms (>4 mm) than found in currently available in vitro models. Bacterial viability was excellent in the bioprinted constructs, with CLSM observation of bacterial biofilm production and maturation possible for at least 28 d in culture. Importantly, we observed the complete five-step biofilm life cycle in vitro following 3D bioprinting for the first time, suggesting the formation of mature 3D bioprinted biofilms. Bacterial growth was faster in thinner, more porous constructs whilst constructs crosslinked with BaCl2 concentrations of above 10 mM had denser biofilm formation. 3D MRSA and MSSA biofilm constructs were found to show greater resistance to antimicrobials than corresponding two-dimensional (2D) cultures.

What unexpected role does the AcrD efflux pump play in Salmonella beyond antibiotic resistance?,"The results of these diverse experiments provide strong evidence that the AcrD efflux pump is not simply a redundant system providing response resilience, but also has distinct physiological functions.","file, distinct from other Salmonella efflux pumps. Here we show that inactivation of acrD results in a profoundly altered transcriptome and modulation of pathways integral to Salmonella biology. The most significant transcriptome changes were central metabolism related, with additional changes observed in pathogenicity, environmental sensing, and stress response pathway expression. The extent of tricarboxylic acid cycle and fumarate metabolism expression changes led us to hypothesize that acrD inactivation may result in motility defects due to perturbation of metabolite concentrations, such as fumarate, for which a role in motility has been established. Despite minimal detectable changes in flagellar gene expression, we found that an acrD mutant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate was significantly impaired for swarming motility, which was restored by addition of fumarate. The acrD mutant outcompeted the wild type in fitness experiments. The results of these diverse experiments provide strong evidence that the AcrD efflux pump is not simply a redundant system providing response resilience, but also has distinct physiological functions. Together, these data indicate that the AcrD efflux pump has a significant and previously underappreciated impact on bacterial biology, despite only minor perturbations of antibiotic resistance profiles. IMPORTANCE Efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria are studied because of their important contributions to antimicrobial resistance. However, the role of these pumps in bacterial biology has remained surprisingly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that loss of the AcrD efflux pump significantly impacts the physiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

What did the governance analysis reveal about antimicrobial resistance action plans worldwide?,International efforts to control antimicrobial resistance varied considerably between countries,"luate current progress and direct future planning. National action plans (NAPs) are the primary mechanism for guiding national strategy and action for antimicrobial resistance governance. Although several NAPs have been developed, no comprehensive content analysis of these plans exists. Using a governance framework, we aimed to assess all publicly available NAPs on antimicrobial resistance.We systematically reviewed the contents of NAPs on antimicrobial resistance from 114 countries, applying a governance framework containing 18 domains and 54 indicators in three integral areas: policy design, implementation tools, and monitoring and evaluation. As well as manually searching NAPs and doing online and literature searches that were relevant to specific indicators from repository inception to June 1, 2022, several data sources were used to generate scores, including the Tripartite Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self-Assessment Survey, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Development Hub, and various WHO datasets. NAPs were included if the country had also submitted the NAP to the Tripartite Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self-Assessment Survey 2020-21, if the NAP was retrievable through a publicly accessible database or website, and if the NAP was either published in English or eligible for machine translation. Three researchers independently reviewed each NAP and were initially blinded to the evaluations of other researchers. They generated a score using a quantification system for each of 54 indicators. The Cochrane protocol for ensuring reliability was followed. The three researchers were then unblinded and met to resolve any disagreements in scoring to reach a consensus agreement. In each case of discrepancy, consensus was reached between the researchers. We developed criteria to standardise the process of quantifying each indicator.

Both acquired antibiotic resistance genes and phylogroups were identified from de novo assemblies and SNP based phylogenetic analyses were used to visualize the distribution of resistance genes in E. coli isolates from the two hosts. Greater acquired AMR gene diversity was detected in human compared to bovine E. coli isolates across multiple classes of antibiotics with particular resistance genes for extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL), quinolones, macrolides and fosfomycin only detected in E. coli genomes of human origin. The striking difference was that the Zambian or wider African human isolates were significantly more likely to possess multiple acquired AMR genes compared to the Zambian dairy cattle isolates. The median number of resistance genes in the Zambian cattle cohort was 0 (0-1 interquartile range), while in the Zambian human and wider African cohorts the medians and interquartile ranges were 6 (4-9) and 6 (0-8), respectively. The lower frequency and reduced diversity of acquired AMR genes in the dairy cattle isolates is concordant with relatively limited antibiotic use that we have documented in this region, especially among smallholder farmers.

The survey sought information on the most prevalent animal diseases, veterinarians' awareness of potential preventive measures, including factors determining antimicrobial prescribing; the types of antimicrobials used for different health conditions in different species, and possible options to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU). The majority (86%) of respondents worked for the government, 98% reported having no written policy for the use of veterinary health products, and 58% have no on-site diagnostic facilities. Ceftriaxone, Enrofloxacin, and Oxytetracycline were the antibiotics (ABX) most frequently prescribed, by 76, 68, and 54% of veterinarians, respectively. These ABX were prescribed mainly for respiratory health problems and mastitis in cattle, and gastrointestinal infections in buffaloes, sheep, goat, and pigs. Severity of clinical symptoms, economic status of the livestock owner, and withdrawal period for ABX were ranked as very important factors for giving ABX. Less than two thirds (64%) were aware of the government ban for Colistin and only 2% were aware of a national plan for AMR. This study highlighted that ABX prescription is mostly based on tentative diagnosis given the lack of diagnostic facilities in most veterinary clinics.

However, in the past few decades, misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of bacterial infections resistant to multiple drugs, a significant health concern. Bacteria exposed to inappropriate levels of antibiotics lead to several genetic changes, enabling them to survive in the host and become more resistant. Despite the understanding and targeting of genetic-based biochemical changes in the bacteria, the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance are not under control. Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival. In this review article, epigenetic changes leading to the development of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria are discussed. Additionally, recent lines of evidence focusing on human host epigenetic changes due to the human-pathogen interactions are presented. As genetic mechanisms cannot explain the transient nature of antimicrobial resistance, we believe that epigenetics may provide new frontiers in antimicrobial discovery.""

Common ESBLs and carbapenem-resistance mechanisms were determined in Escherichia coli isolates using PCR assays. Incompatibility typing of the conjugable plasmids was determined by PCR-based replicon typing; the phylotypes and MLSTs were also analysed. Results A total of 301 (59.7%) samples showed significant bacteriuria along with symptoms of UTI and among them 103 isolates were identified as E. coli of multiple STs (ST3268, ST3430, ST4671 and others). Among them, 26.2% (27/103) were phenotypically ESBL producers whereas 12.6% (13/103) were carbapenemase producers. This study describes the occurrence of diverse ESBL genes—blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-148, blaPER-1 and blaTEM— and two E. coli isolates carrying the blaNDM-1 carbapenemase gene. ESBL genes were located within transconjugable plasmids of IncP and IncF type whereas blaNDM-1 was carried in an IncFrepB type plasmid. Conclusions This study illustrates the high rate of MDR in E. coli causing UTI in primary care in rural Assam. UTIs caused by ESBL- or MBL- producing bacteria are very difficult to treat and can often lead to treatment failure. Thus, future research should focus on rapid diagnostics to enable targeted treatment options and reduce the treatment failure likely to occur with commonly prescribed antibiotics, which will help to combat antimicrobial resistance and the burden of UTIs.""

In recent years, many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have implemented policies to optimise antibiotic use in both formal and informal healthcare settings. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of these national efforts in LMICs. Methods We investigated the empirical relationship between national policies aimed at restricting antibiotic use and actual antibiotic consumption in 138 LMICs. Data on national policies were obtained from the Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS) as well as from the Global Survey of Experts on AMR (GSEAR). Seven independent variables relating to AMR policies were evaluated. Outcomes included the proportion of children receiving antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea (specific to paediatric populations), along with total antibiotic consumption and AMR-associated mortality in general populations. Results Our analysis of 138 LMICs found wide variation in antibiotic use between countries and regions. We observed strong evidence of negative association (mean difference MD=−0.150, 95% CI (−0.2593 to –0.0407)) between the presence of regulatory or legislative policies that ban over-the-counter sales of antibiotics and the proportion of children receiving antibiotic drugs for lower respiratory tract infection. Furthermore, stronger AMR governance was associated with reduced total antibiotic consumption at the country level (MD=−1.259, 95% CI (−2.297 to –0.2216)). No associations were found between other policy variables and antibiotic use or mortality.

The study used a telephone survey of 50 veterinarians conducted in five districts in Assam state, India. The survey sought information on the most prevalent animal diseases, veterinarians' awareness of potential preventive measures, including factors determining antimicrobial prescribing; the types of antimicrobials used for different health conditions in different species, and possible options to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU). The majority (86%) of respondents worked for the government, 98% reported having no written policy for the use of veterinary health products, and 58% have no on-site diagnostic facilities. Ceftriaxone, Enrofloxacin, and Oxytetracycline were the antibiotics (ABX) most frequently prescribed, by 76, 68, and 54% of veterinarians, respectively. These ABX were prescribed mainly for respiratory health problems and mastitis in cattle, and gastrointestinal infections in buffaloes, sheep, goat, and pigs. Severity of clinical symptoms, economic status of the livestock owner, and withdrawal period for ABX were ranked as very important factors for giving ABX. Less than two thirds (64%) were aware of the government ban for Colistin and only 2% were aware of a national plan for AMR. This study highlighted that ABX prescription is mostly based on tentative diagnosis given the lack of diagnostic facilities in most veterinary clinics. There is a need to enhance veterinary healthcare and to improve communication between policy makers and field veterinarians and, importantly, a need to disseminate clear prescribing guidelines on prudent AMU.""

We compared our predictions with available clinical phenotypic data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from eight antimicrobial classes and 12 genera from 56 countries.Using antimicrobial use data from between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2019, we found that antimicrobial usage was not significantly associated with the global ARG abundance in sewage (p=0·72; incidence rate ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·92-1·13]), whereas country-specific World Bank's variables explained a large amount of variation. The importance of the World Bank variables differed between antimicrobial classes and countries. Generally, the estimated global ARG abundance was positively associated with the prevalence of clinical phenotypic resistance, with a strong association for bacterial groups in the human gut. The associations between bacterial groups and ARG abundance were positive and significantly different from zero for the aminoglycosides (three of the four of the taxa tested), β-lactam (all the six microbial groups), fluoroquinolones (seven of nine of the microbial groups), glycopeptide (one microbial group tested), folate pathway antagonists (four of five microbial groups), and tetracycline (two of nine microbial groups).Metagenomic analysis of sewage is a robust approach for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens, especially for bacterial groups associated with the human gut.

Despite this inconvenient fact, political imperative and expedience, among other drivers, have given substantial impetus to an interventionist approach against what are considered to be the culprits for the apparent growing prevalence of AMR and its impacts. Concern about the rise in prevalence of microbial infections that are resistant to therapeutic agents designed to kill them has arisen almost exclusively in relation to human health. (Public awareness and concern about antihelmintic resistance, for which the impacts are much more substantial for animal health, at least in developed temperate countries, are trivial by comparison). Nevertheless, antimicrobial drugs have been, and are, widely used in animal health and production throughout the world, and the contribution of this diverse usage to the ‘global AMR problem’ has historically been controversial. There is growing acceptance, notwithstanding the limitations in causal understanding noted previously, of AMR as an ecological problem of competing populations of microorganisms experiencing both natural and anthropogenic selection pressures in compartments that transcend species and other boundaries.

Understanding the emergence and spread of AMR between different bacterial species is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper we describe a user-friendly, affordable and comprehensive (laboratory and bioinformatics) workflow that is able to identify, associate and track AMR genes in bacteria. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the method by comparing 50 faecal microbiomes from pig farms with high-antibiotic use (conventional farms), and 50 faecal microbiomes from pig farms with low-antibiotic use (organic farms).

However, in the past few decades, misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of bacterial infections resistant to multiple drugs, a significant health concern. Bacteria exposed to inappropriate levels of antibiotics lead to several genetic changes, enabling them to survive in the host and become more resistant. Despite the understanding and targeting of genetic-based biochemical changes in the bacteria, the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance are not under control. Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival. In this review article, epigenetic changes leading to the development of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria are discussed. Additionally, recent lines of evidence focusing on human host epigenetic changes due to the human-pathogen interactions are presented.
