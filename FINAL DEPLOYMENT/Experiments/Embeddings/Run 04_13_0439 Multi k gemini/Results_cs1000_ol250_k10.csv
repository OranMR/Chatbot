How does the AcrD efflux pump affect Salmonella fitness and behavior beyond antibiotic resistance?,The acrD mutant outcompeted the wild type in fitness experiments.,"icrobial resistance. However, the role of these pumps in bacterial biology has remained surprisingly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that loss of the AcrD efflux pump significantly impacts the physiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Inactivation of acrD led to changes in the expression of 403 genes involved in fundamental processes, including basic metabolism, virulence, and stress responses. Pathways such as these allow Salmonella to grow, survive in the environment, and cause disease. Indeed, our data show that the acrD mutant is more fit than wild-type Salmonella under standard lab conditions. We hypothesized that inactivation of acrD would alter levels of bacterial metabolites, impacting traits such as swarming motility. We demonstrated this by exogenous addition of the metabolite fumarate, which partially restored the acrD mutant’s swarming defect.
