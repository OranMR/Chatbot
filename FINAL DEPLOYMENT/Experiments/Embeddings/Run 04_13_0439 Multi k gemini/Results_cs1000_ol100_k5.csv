In this review article, epigenetic changes leading to the development of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria are discussed.

How does the AcrD efflux pump affect Salmonella fitness and behavior beyond antibiotic resistance?,The acrD mutant outcompeted the wild type in fitness experiments.,"ply a redundant system providing response resilience, but also has distinct physiological functions. Together, these data indicate that the AcrD efflux pump has a significant and previously underappreciated impact on bacterial biology, despite only minor perturbations of antibiotic resistance profiles. IMPORTANCE Efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria are studied because of their important contributions to antimicrobial resistance. However, the role of these pumps in bacterial biology has remained surprisingly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that loss of the AcrD efflux pump significantly impacts the physiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Inactivation of acrD led to changes in the expression of 403 genes involved in fundamental processes, including basic metabolism, virulence, and stress responses. Pathways such as these allow Salmonella to grow, survive in the environment, and cause disease. Indeed, our data show that the acrD mutant is more fit than wild-type Salmonella under standard lab conditions.",0.7662881016731262,0.01662049861495845,0.15126050420168066,True,False,True,True

There is growing acceptance, notwithstanding the limitations in causal understanding noted previously, of AMR as an ecological problem of competing populations of microorganisms experiencing both natural and anthropogenic selection pressures in compartments that transcend species and other boundaries.

In animals, this calls into question the motivations and practices for antimicrobial drug usage, the majority of which are justified on the basis of promoting animal health and welfare and securing a food supply for a growing human population.
