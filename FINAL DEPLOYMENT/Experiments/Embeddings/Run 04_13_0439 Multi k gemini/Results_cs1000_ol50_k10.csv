Together, these data indicate that the AcrD efflux pump has a significant and previously underappreciated impact on bacterial biology, despite only minor perturbations of antibiotic resistance profiles. IMPORTANCE Efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria are studied because of their important contributions to antimicrobial resistance. However, the role of these pumps in bacterial biology has remained surprisingly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that loss of the AcrD efflux pump significantly impacts the physiology of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Inactivation of acrD led to changes in the expression of 403 genes involved in fundamental processes, including basic metabolism, virulence, and stress responses. Pathways such as these allow Salmonella to grow, survive in the environment, and cause disease. Indeed, our data show that the acrD mutant is more fit than wild-type Salmonella under standard lab conditions.",0.7626147270202637,0.01634877384196185,0.15517241379310345,True,False,True,True
