Nevertheless, antimicrobial drugs have been, and are, widely used in animal health and production throughout the world, and the contribution of this diverse usage to the ‘global AMR problem’ has historically been controversial. There is growing acceptance, notwithstanding the limitations in causal understanding noted previously, of AMR as an ecological problem of competing populations of microorganisms experiencing both natural and anthropogenic selection pressures in compartments that transcend species and other boundaries.",0.5822494029998779,0.04284103720405862,0.22000000000000003,False,False,False,False

Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens.

In this review article, epigenetic changes leading to the development of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria are discussed.",0.7610085010528564,0.30892143808255657,0.425,True,False,True,True
