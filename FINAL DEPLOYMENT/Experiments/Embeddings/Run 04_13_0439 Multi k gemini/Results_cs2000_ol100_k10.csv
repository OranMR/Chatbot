Whole genome sequencing is revealing and beginning to quantify the two-way traffic of AMR bacteria between the farm and the clinic. Surveillance of bacterial disease, drug usage and resistance in livestock is still relatively poor, though improving, but achieving better antimicrobial stewardship on the farm is challenging: antibiotics are an integral part of industrial agriculture and there are very few alternatives. Human production and use of antibiotics either on the farm or in the clinic is but a recent addition to the natural and ancient process of antibiotic production and resistance evolution that occurs on a global scale in the soil.

Resistant bacteria in flies often share the same genotypes with bacteria from humans and animals when their habitat overlap. The risk of transmission is most likely highest for enteric bacteria as they are shed in high concentration in excrements and are easily picked up by flies. ‘Filth flies’ can ‘bio-enhance’ the transmission of AMR as bacteria multiply in the digestive tract, mouthparts and regurgitation spots.

Here, the influence of diet on the ruminal resistome and abundance of pathogenicity genes was assessed in ruminal digesta samples taken from 50 antibiotic-free beef cattle, comprising four cattle breeds receiving two diets containing different proportions of concentrate. Two hundred and four genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR), colonisation, communication or pathogenicity functions were identified from 4966 metagenomic genes using KEGG identification. Both the diversity and abundance of these genes were higher in concentrate-fed animals. Chloramphenicol and microcin resistance genes were dominant in samples from forage-fed animals (P < 0.001), while aminoglycoside and streptomycin resistances were enriched in concentrate-fed animals. The concentrate-based diet also increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, which includes many animal and zoonotic pathogens. A high ratio of Proteobacteria to (Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes) was confirmed as a good indicator for rumen dysbiosis, with eight cases all from concentrate-fed animals.

Bacterial viability was excellent in the bioprinted constructs, with CLSM observation of bacterial biofilm production and maturation possible for at least 28 d in culture. Importantly, we observed the complete five-step biofilm life cycle in vitro following 3D bioprinting for the first time, suggesting the formation of mature 3D bioprinted biofilms. Bacterial growth was faster in thinner, more porous constructs whilst constructs crosslinked with BaCl2 concentrations of above 10 mM had denser biofilm formation. 3D MRSA and MSSA biofilm constructs were found to show greater resistance to antimicrobials than corresponding two-dimensional (2D) cultures.

Identifiable traits of the wildlife contribute to this exposure; however, compared with humans, livestock, and the environment, low phenotypic diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant resistance. Wildlife that interact closely with humans, livestock, and both human and livestock waste within households, are exposed to more antimicrobial resistant phenotypes, and could therefore act as conduits for the dissemination of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance to the wider environment.

What unexpected role does the AcrD efflux pump play in Salmonella beyond antibiotic resistance?,"The results of these diverse experiments provide strong evidence that the AcrD efflux pump is not simply a redundant system providing response resilience, but also has distinct physiological functions.","stance (MDR) efflux pumps have been studied because of their impact on resistance to antimicrobials. However, critical questions remain, including why produce efflux pumps under non-antimicrobial treatment conditions, and why have multiple pumps if their only purpose is antimicrobial efflux? Salmonella spp. possess five efflux pump families, including the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps. Notably, the RND efflux pump AcrD has a unique substrate profile, distinct from other Salmonella efflux pumps. Here we show that inactivation of acrD results in a profoundly altered transcriptome and modulation of pathways integral to Salmonella biology. The most significant transcriptome changes were central metabolism related, with additional changes observed in pathogenicity, environmental sensing, and stress response pathway expression. The extent of tricarboxylic acid cycle and fumarate metabolism expression changes led us to hypothesize that acrD inactivation may result in motility defects due to perturbation of metabolite concentrations, such as fumarate, for which a role in motility has been established. Despite minimal detectable changes in flagellar gene expression, we found that an acrD mutant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate was significantly impaired for swarming motility, which was restored by addition of fumarate. The acrD mutant outcompeted the wild type in fitness experiments. The results of these diverse experiments provide strong evidence that the AcrD efflux pump is not simply a redundant system providing response resilience, but also has distinct physiological functions. Together, these data indicate that the AcrD efflux pump has a significant and previously underappreciated impact on bacterial biology, despite only minor perturbations of antibiotic resistance profiles. IMPORTANCE Efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria are studied because of their important contributions to antimicrobial resistance. However, the role of these pumps in bacterial biology has remained surprisingly elusive.",0.7423179149627686,0.029263831732967534,0.2758620689655173,True,True,True,True

ARG and microbiota compositions were correlated (Procrustes analysis, p =0.014). Total antimicrobial usage was not associated with higher ARG abundance in wastewater. However, there was a small positive association between resistance genes and antimicrobial usage matched to ARG phenotype (IRR 1.11, CI 1.06–1.16, p &amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, analyzing carbapenem and vancomycin resistance separately indicated that counts of ARGs to these antimicrobials were positively associated with their increased usage [carbapenem rate ratio (RR) 1.91, 95% CI 1.01– 3.72, p =0.07, and vancomycin RR 10.25, CI 2.32–49.10, p &amp;lt;0.01]. Overall, ARG abundance within hospital wastewater did not reflect resistance patterns in clinical isolates from concurrent hospital inpatients. However, for clinical isolates of the family Enterococcaceae and Staphylococcaceae , there was a positive relationship with wastewater ARG abundance [odds ratio (OR) 1.62, CI 1.33–2.00, p &amp;lt;0.001, and OR 1.65, CI 1.21–2.30, p =0.006 respectively]. Conclusion: We found that the relationship between hospital wastewater ARGs and antimicrobial usage or clinical isolate resistance varies by specific antimicrobial and bacterial family studied. One explanation, we consider is that relationships observed from multiple departments within a single hospital site will be detectable only for ARGs against parenteral antimicrobials uniquely used in the hospital setting.

However, in the past few decades, misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of bacterial infections resistant to multiple drugs, a significant health concern. Bacteria exposed to inappropriate levels of antibiotics lead to several genetic changes, enabling them to survive in the host and become more resistant. Despite the understanding and targeting of genetic-based biochemical changes in the bacteria, the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance are not under control. Many reports hint at the role of epigenetic modifications in the bacterial genome and host epigenetic reprogramming due to interaction with resistant pathogens. Epigenetic changes, such as the DNA-methylation-based regulation of bacterial mutation rates or bacteria-induced histone modification in human epithelial cells, facilitate its long-term survival.

Methods Freshly voided midstream urine samples were collected from patients attending primary healthcare centres, with the patients’ epidemiological data also recorded. Species identification was confirmed using a VITEK 2 compact automated system. Phenotypic confirmation of ESBLs was performed using the combined disc diffusion method (CLSI 2017) and carbapenemase production was phenotypically characterized using a modified Hodge test. Common ESBLs and carbapenem-resistance mechanisms were determined in Escherichia coli isolates using PCR assays. Incompatibility typing of the conjugable plasmids was determined by PCR-based replicon typing; the phylotypes and MLSTs were also analysed. Results A total of 301 (59.7%) samples showed significant bacteriuria along with symptoms of UTI and among them 103 isolates were identified as E. coli of multiple STs (ST3268, ST3430, ST4671 and others).

Seven independent variables pertaining to AMR policies were evaluated. Outcomes were the proportion of children receiving antibiotics for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea as well as total antibiotic consumption and mortality associated with antimicrobial-resistant infections.Results: Our analysis of 138 LMICs found wide variation in antibiotic use between countries and regions. We observed a significant negative association (mean difference MD = -0.150, 95% CI [-0.2593, -0.0407]) between the presence of regulatory or legislative policies that ban over-the-counter sales of antibiotics and the proportion of children under five receiving antibiotic drugs for lower respiratory tract infection.

What is a major human factor influencing antibiotic use in animal farming?,The study fills a conspicuous gap in the existing AMR and One Health literatures examining links between farm management practices and AMU and AMR in European livestock production.,"ducted a sensitivity analysis, and investigated the impact of curtailing antibiotic usage in animals on resistance levels in humans. Results Our findings suggest that human resistance levels are most sensitive to both parameters associated with the human compartment (rate of loss of resistance from humans) and parameters associated with the environmental compartment (rate of loss of resistance from the environment and the transmission rate from the environment to humans). The impact of curtailing antibiotic consumption in animals on long term prevalence of AMR in humans was weaker when environmental transmission was assumed to be high. Conclusions This study highlights that environment-human sharing of resistance can influence the epidemiology of resistant bacterial infections in humans and reduce the impact of interventions that curtail antibiotic consumption in animals.

These efforts ignited management shifts ranging from largely nominal (e.g., drugs banned for use as ‘growth promoters’ were reclassified as ‘prophylactic’ drugs) to organic farming, which drastically reduces or eliminates use of antimicrobials. Understanding how these farming practices influence the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in livestock carries important implications for policy makers, public health officials, and farm managers. Here, we reviewed studies spanning the last 20 years to ask if the most stringent effort to reduce antimicrobial use in livestock — organic farming — results in notable reductions in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance across broad scale geographic ranges, pathogens, and livestock hosts.",0.5939124226570129,0.01673271686481726,0.22680412371134023,True,False,False,False

We compared our predictions with available clinical phenotypic data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from eight antimicrobial classes and 12 genera from 56 countries.Using antimicrobial use data from between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2019, we found that antimicrobial usage was not significantly associated with the global ARG abundance in sewage (p=0·72; incidence rate ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·92-1·13]), whereas country-specific World Bank's variables explained a large amount of variation. The importance of the World Bank variables differed between antimicrobial classes and countries. Generally, the estimated global ARG abundance was positively associated with the prevalence of clinical phenotypic resistance, with a strong association for bacterial groups in the human gut. The associations between bacterial groups and ARG abundance were positive and significantly different from zero for the aminoglycosides (three of the four of the taxa tested), β-lactam (all the six microbial groups), fluoroquinolones (seven of nine of the microbial groups), glycopeptide (one microbial group tested), folate pathway antagonists (four of five microbial groups), and tetracycline (two of nine microbial groups).Metagenomic analysis of sewage is a robust approach for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens, especially for bacterial groups associated with the human gut.

Despite this inconvenient fact, political imperative and expedience, among other drivers, have given substantial impetus to an interventionist approach against what are considered to be the culprits for the apparent growing prevalence of AMR and its impacts. Concern about the rise in prevalence of microbial infections that are resistant to therapeutic agents designed to kill them has arisen almost exclusively in relation to human health. (Public awareness and concern about antihelmintic resistance, for which the impacts are much more substantial for animal health, at least in developed temperate countries, are trivial by comparison). Nevertheless, antimicrobial drugs have been, and are, widely used in animal health and production throughout the world, and the contribution of this diverse usage to the ‘global AMR problem’ has historically been controversial. There is growing acceptance, notwithstanding the limitations in causal understanding noted previously, of AMR as an ecological problem of competing populations of microorganisms experiencing both natural and anthropogenic selection pressures in compartments that transcend species and other boundaries. Typifying what is described as a ‘One Health’ problem, AMR is therefore considered to be most amenable to conjoint mitigation efforts in all compartments: i.e. interventions in human health, animal health, food and the environment in a coherent manner. In animals, this calls into question the motivations and practices for antimicrobial drug usage, the majority of which are justified on the basis of promoting animal health and welfare and securing a food supply for a growing human population.
