Why is antibiotic resistance in animals an ethical and ecological issue?,"Despite a large and rapidly growing volume of research activity and output, primarily on the biological bases of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), epidemiological understanding of the causal mechanisms at play behind the apparent recent global rise in prevalence of AMR has, arguably, progressed very little."," sharing of resistance can influence the epidemiology of resistant bacterial infections in humans and reduce the impact of interventions that curtail antibiotic consumption in animals. More data on the types and dynamics of resistance in the environment and frequency of human-environment transmission is crucial to understanding the population dynamics of antibiotic resistance.""
