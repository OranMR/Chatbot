How is Uganda trying to monitor antibiotic resistance?,This article examines efforts and progress in developing and implementing a human health antimicrobial resistance surveillance strategy in Uganda.,em. This article examines efforts and progress in developing and implementing a human health antimicrobial resistance surveillance strategy in Uganda. We do so within the context of the National Action Plan for tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR-NAP) launched in 2018. We discuss the technical milestones and progress in implementing surveillance of GLASS priority pathogens under this framework. The preliminary output of the framework examines the performance and compares AMR and AMU surveillance data to explain observed trends.,0.7191425561904907,0.4842454394693201,0.5,True,True,True,True
