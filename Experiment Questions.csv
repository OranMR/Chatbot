What global surveillance method for antimicrobial resistance was proposed using untreated sewage?,Metagenomic analysis of sewage is proposed as an ethically acceptable and economically feasible approach for continuous global surveillance and prediction of AMR.
what is antimicrobial resistance (AMR) described as in relation to global health?,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is described as a serious threat to global public health.
What correlation was found between AMR gene abundance and other factors in the global sewage study?,"AMR gene abundance strongly correlates with socio-economic, health and environmental factors."
How many countries were included in the genomic analysis of sewage for antimicrobial resistance study?,"The genomic analysis of sewage included 101 countries, with 757 sewage samples from 243 cities collected from 2016 to 2019"
What is suggested as a potential governance structure for addressing antimicrobial resistance similar to climate change?,"An intergovernmental panel, akin to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is suggested as an appropriate vehicle to actively address the problem of antimicrobial resistance."
What unusual vector for antimicrobial resistance is discussed regarding insects?,Filth flies' are potential vectors for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact antibiotic use?,"Antibiotic use in SARS-CoV-2 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic exceeded the incidence of bacterial coinfections and secondary infections, suggesting inappropriate and excessive prescribing."
What dietary factor was found to influence antimicrobial resistance genes in beef cattle?,The concentrate-based diet (as opposed to forage-based diet) increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and affected the complement of AMR genes in the rumen microbial community.
"In the Nairobi study, what conclusion was drawn about wildlife as a source or sink of antimicrobial resistance?","The study found that compared with humans, livestock, and the environment, low phenotypic diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant resistance."
What technique was used in the study on 3D bacterial biofilms that allowed for antimicrobial resistance drug testing?,3D bioprinting using a double-crosslinked alginate bioink was used to form mature bacteria biofilms for antimicrobial resistance drug testing.
