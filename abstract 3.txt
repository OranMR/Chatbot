f engineered nanomaterials (NMs) is paramount to the responsible and sustainable development of nanotechnology, which provides huge societal benefits. Currently, there is no evidence that engineered NMs cause detrimental health effects in humans. However, investigation of NM toxicity using in vivo, in vitro, in chemico, and in silico models has demonstrated that some NMs stimulate oxidative stress and inflammation, which may lead to adverse health effects. Accordingly, investigation of these responses currently dominates NM safety assessments.

There is a need to reduce reliance on rodent testing in nanotoxicology for ethical, financial and legislative reasons, and due to evidence that rodent models do not always predict the human response. We advocate that in vitro models and zebrafish embryos should have greater prominence in screening for NM safety, to better align nanotoxicology with the 3Rs principles.

volved in many cellular processes. Ligand-controlled regulation is easily recognizable, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. We have obtained the first complete series of allosteric structures, in all possible ligated states, for the tetrameric enzyme, pyruvate kinase, from Leishmania mexicana. The transition between inactive T-state and active R-state is accompanied by a simple symmetrical 6 degrees rigid body rocking motion of the Aand C-domain cores in each of the four subunits.

Prions initially accumulate in the lymphoid system before spreading to the nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms for prion transfer between the two systems are still elusive. Here we show that ablation of the B-cell-specific transmembrane protein CD19, a coreceptor of the complement system, results in an acceleration of prion neuroinvasion.

The most important host factor in inbred mouse strains is their genetically determined susceptibility or resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. Secondly, the age of the mice is crucial for the outcome of infection. Resistance is only slowly developed by newborn mice, while aged mice possess an increased non-specific resistance as compared to young adult animals.

The strategy relies on the combination of aminocatalysis-mediated on-resin Ugi reactions and peptide couplings for the N-alkylation of peptides at selected sites, including the N-terminal double lipidation, the simultaneous lipidation/biotinylation, and the steroid/lipid conjugation via tetrazole ring formation.

The solid-phase Ugi four-component reactions were enabled by on-resin transimination steps prior to addition of the acid and isocyanide components. The strategy proved to be suitable for the feasible incorporation of complex N-substituents at both termini and at internal positions, which is not easily achievable by other solid-phase methods.

This result brings into focus recently published microarray datasets that identify high expression of endothelial cell-associated genes by KCs compared with other tissue-resident mj. Our studies also revealed significant and specific loss of KCs among leukocytes with commonly used isolation methods that led to enrichment of proliferating and monocyte-derived mj.

Polymorphisms, mutations, and autoantibodies affecting factor H (FH), a major regulator of the alternative complement pathway, are associated with various diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and C3 glomerulopathies. Restoring FH function could be a treatment option for such pathologies.

Furthermore, mini-FH efficiently inhibited complement-mediated lysis of host-like cells caused by a disease-associated FH mutation or by anti-FH autoantibodies. Therefore, mini-FH could potentially be used as a complement inhibitor targeting host surfaces, as well as to replace compromised FH in diseases associated with FH dysfunction.

allenges intrinsic to the accurate diagnosis of endometriosis contribute to an extended delay between the onset of symptoms and clinical confirmation. Intraoperative visualization, preferably with histologic verification, is considered by many professional organizations to be the gold standard by which endometriosis is diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis via patient history, physical examination, and noninvasive tests, though more easily executed, is generally viewed as less accurate than surgical diagnosis.

The deletion seems to be linked to one of the two protective CFH haplotypes which are both tagged by the protective allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs2274700 (CFH:A473A). In a German cohort of 530 AMD patients, we now show that protection against AMD conferred by DCFHR3/CFHR1 is independent of the effects of rs2274700 and rs1061170 (CFH:Y402H).

This suggests a functional role of CFHR1 and/or CFHR3 in disease pathogenesis. We therefore characterized the CFHR3 function and identified CFHR3 as a novel human complement regulator that inhibits C3 convertase activity. CFHR3 displays anti-inflammatory effects by blocking C5a generation and C5a-mediated chemoattraction of neutrophils.

Most importantly, a putative proteinase K (PK)-sensitive form of PrP(Sc) (sPrP(Sc)) is being increasingly investigated for its possible role in prion infectivity, neurotoxicity, and strain variability. The study of sPrP(Sc), however, remains technically challenging because of the need of separating it from PrP(C) without using proteases.

It has been reported that the QseBC two-component sensory system regulates motility and virulence-associated genes in other Gram-negative bacteria in response to stress-related catecholamines, albeit disparities between studies exist.

The ubiquitous nature and possible severe consequences of disease with these nematodes make them the prime targets of current worm control programmes.

Following decades of routine and frequent anthelmintic applications, many cyathostomin populations on horse farms in industrialised countries must be considered as resistant to BZ anthelmintics.

Possibly this is due to the generally subclinical and unspecific symptoms associated with cyathostomin infections. Nevertheless, exclusive reliance on the ML drug class may increase the threat of clinical disease due to drug-resistant cyathostomins. More recently, P. equorum has been reported as having developed resistance against ivermectin and moxidectin, two representatives of the ML-class.

These anthelmintics are currently the most frequently used drug class in horses. This nematode species is mainly found in foals and in younger horses due to the development of immunity following exposure to infection. Infection with P. equorum can result in clinically drastic consequences such as obstruction and/or penetration of the small intestine, the latter usually leading to death.

In terms of antibiotic potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, authentic allicin had roughly 1-2% of the potency of streptomycin (vs. S. aureus), 8% of that of vancomycin (vs. S. aureus), and only 0.2% of that of colistin (vs. E. coli).

To confidently attribute shifts in immune bias to the presence of a co-infecting parasite, we suggest practical approaches to account for antibody cross-reactivity.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) produced by mucosal B cells dictates the composition of commensal bacteria residing within the intestine. While emerging evidence suggests the majority of IgA is produced innately and may be polyreactive, mucosal-dwelling species can also elicit IgA via T cell-dependent mechanisms.

3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) regulate steady state interactions between T follicular helper cells (TfH) and B cells to limit mucosal IgA responses. ILC3 used conserved migratory cues to establish residence within the interfollicular regions of the intestinal draining lymph nodes, where they act to limit TfH responses and B cell class switching through antigen presentation. The absence of ILC3-intrinsic antigen presentation resulted in increased and selective IgA coating of bacteria residing within the colonic mucosa.

Here, we show that the MR and other members of the mineralocorticoid signalling pathway including HSP90 and FKBP4, possess anti-viral activity against HSV-1 independent of their effect on sodium transport, as shown by sodium channel inhibitors. Expression of the MR is upregulated upon infection in an interferon (IFN) and viral transcriptional activator VP16-dependent fashion.

Furthermore, the MR and VP16, together with the cellular co-activator Oct-1, transactivate the hormone response element (HRE) present in the MR promoter and those of its transcriptional targets. As the MR induces IFN expression, our data suggests the MR is involved in a positive feedback loop that controls HSV-1 infection.

These two subspecies can resist human ApoL1 because they express the serum resistance proteins T. b. gambiense glycoprotein (TgsGP) and serum resistance-associated protein (SRA), respectively. Whereas in T. b. rhodesiense, SRA is necessary and sufficient to inhibit ApoL1, in T. b.

Whereas in T. b. rhodesiense, SRA is necessary and sufficient to inhibit ApoL1, in T. b. gambiense, TgsGP cannot protect against high ApoL1 uptake, so different additional mechanisms contribute to limit this uptake. Here we report a complex interplay between trypanosomes and an ApoL1 variant, revealing important insights into innate human immunity against these parasites. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized an atypical T. b. gambiense infection in a patient in Ghana.

nofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is considered reversible by discontinuing TDF administration, but there are occasional cases of incomplete recovery. We investigated the recovery of renal function after the discontinuation of TDF. Subjects comprised patients who had been started on TDF but in whom it was later discontinued because of impaired renal function. We investigated renal function until 96 weeks after the discontinuation of TDF, and the duration of TDF administration, up to May 2010.

f farmers reported treating cattle with a pyrethroid, and chemical analysis indicated 18% of individual cattle had been treated, in the previous week. Treatment of cattle was estimated to increase daily mortality of tsetse by 5-14%. Trypanosome prevalence in tsetse, predominantly from wildlife areas, was 1.25% for T. brucei s.l. and 0.03% for T. b. rhodesiense. For 750 cattle sampled from 48 herds, 2.3% were PCR positive for T. brucei s.l. and none for T. b. rhodesiense.

Using mathematical models, we estimated there was 8-29% increase in mortality of tsetse in farming areas and this increase can explain the relatively low prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle. Farmer-led treatment of cattle with pyrethroids is likely, in part, to be limiting the spill-over of human-infective trypanosomes from wildlife areas.

In brief, we had little success in improving predictions in our eastern-United States domain for use in epidemiologic applications. We found positive correlations of AOD with PM2.5 over time, but less correlation for long-term averages over space, unless we used calibration that adjusted for large-scale discrepancy between AOD and PM2.5 (see sections 3, 4, and 5).

Furthermore, we found evidence that some of the correlation between raw AOD and PM2.5 might have been a function of surface brightness related to land use, rather than having been driven by the detection of aerosol in the AOD retrieval algorithms (see sections 4 and 7).

S Houlston, Malcolm G Dunlop Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and has a strong heritable basis. We report a genome-wide association analysis of 34,627 CRC cases and 71,379 controls of European ancestry that identifies SNPs at 31 new CRC risk loci. We also identify eight independent risk SNPs at the new and previously reported European CRC loci, and a further nine CRC SNPs at loci previously only identified in Asian populations.

t risk SNPs at the new and previously reported European CRC loci, and a further nine CRC SNPs at loci previously only identified in Asian populations. We use in situ promoter capture Hi-C (CHi-C), gene expression, and in silico annotation methods to identify likely target genes of CRC SNPs. Whilst these new SNP associations implicate target genes that are enriched for known CRC pathways such as Wnt and BMP, they also highlight novel pathways with no prior links to colorectal tumourigenesis.

These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: F<sub>ROH</sub> equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children.

ges in lifespan are coupled to changes in senescence in different physiological systems and phenotypic traits is a central question in biogerontology. It is underpinned by deeper biological questions about whether or not senescence is a synchronised process, or whether levels of synchrony depend on species or environmental context. Understanding how natural selection shapes patterns of synchrony in senescence across physiological systems and phenotypic traits demands the longitudinal study of many phenotypes under natural conditions.

Importantly, we have identified a novel role for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in the augmentation of monocyte cytokine release in response to LPS.

Activated synovial ILCs, which expressed CD25, IL-33Ra, and TLR9, produced abundant GM-CSF upon stimulation by IL-2, IL-33, or CpG DNA. Loss of GM-CSF production by either ILCs or radio-resistant stromal cells prevented Th17 cell-mediated arthritis.

In addition, IL-10 expression in the CNS late in the EAE disease course has been attributed to recovery. However, it is not known how Treg cells and IL-10 expressions are regulated during EAE. We have previously shown a requirement for B cells in recovery from EAE and here investigated whether this was due to a deficiency in Treg cells and IL-10 in the CNS.

We found that B cell deficiency resulted in a delay in the emergence of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells and IL-10 in the CNS during EAE, but not in the periphery. Reconstitution with wild-type B cells resulted in disease recovery and normalized IL-10 and Foxp3 expression. However, reconstitution with B7-deficient B cells did not.

Unlike HSV, B virus clinical strains were unable to use herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) as a receptor, regardless of conservation of the gD amino acid residues essential for HSV-1 entry via HVEM.

Most types of Stx target cells with globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptors, which are expressed on endothelial cells.

ction is still poorly understood. Most types of Stx target cells with globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptors, which are expressed on endothelial cells. According to current theory, Stx is trafficked on the surface of peripheral blood cells, and transfer of toxin from these trafficking cells to endothelial cells results in microvascular damage to target organs, including the kidneys and brain. Inside the cell, Stx inhibits protein synthesis, resulting in cell death.

anja Stadler, Alexei J Drummond Abstract: Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others.

including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments.

Turnover of glycosomes by autophagy of redundant ones and biogenesis of a new population of organelles play a pivotal role in the efficient adaptation of the glycosomal metabolic repertoire to the sudden, major nutritional changes encountered during the transitions in their life cycle.

ent adaptation of the glycosomal metabolic repertoire to the sudden, major nutritional changes encountered during the transitions in their life cycle. The overall mechanism of glycosome biogenesis is similar to that of peroxisomes in other organisms, but the homologous peroxins involved display low sequence conservation as well as variations in motifs mediating crucial protein-protein interactions in the process.

ous peroxins involved display low sequence conservation as well as variations in motifs mediating crucial protein-protein interactions in the process. The correct compartmentalisation of enzymes is essential for the regulation of the trypanosomatids' metabolism and consequently for their viability. For Trypanosoma brucei it was shown that glycosomes also play a crucial role in its life-cycle regulation: a crucial developmental control switch involves the translocation of a protein phosphatase from the cytosol into the organelles.

Through a kinetic analysis of newly synthesized RNA, we observed that a second step splicing defect (the primary defect) was rapidly followed by the first step of splicing defect. Our results show that knocking down a splicing factor can quickly lead to a recycling defect with splicing factors sequestered in stalled complexes, thereby limiting new rounds of splicing.

In non-human mammals, few studies to date have examined lifelong telomere dynamics and no study has estimated the heritability of TL, despite these being important steps towards assessing the potential of TL as a biomarker of productive lifespan and health in livestock species.

d Abstract: The re-emergence of poxviral zoonotic infections and the threat of bioterrorism emphasise the demand for effective antipoxvirus therapies. Here, we show that carbenoxolone, a pharmacological inhibitor of gap junction function and a compound widely used in cell culture, is capable of hindering the replication of Vaccinia virus, the prototypical poxvirus, in a gap junction-independent manner in a human keratinocyte cell line.

ble of hindering the replication of Vaccinia virus, the prototypical poxvirus, in a gap junction-independent manner in a human keratinocyte cell line. Viral protein synthesis occurs in the presence of carbenoxolone but infectious virion formation is minimal, indicating that carbenoxolone blocks viral morphogenesis. Initial viability tests suggested that carbenoxolone was not toxic to cells. However, electron microscopic analysis of carbenoxolone treated cells revealed that it alters the cellular endomembrane system.

These differences were recapitulated in CD4 transfection assays, which revealed a strong association between CD4 genotypes and SIVcpz infection phenotypes. The most striking differences were observed for three substitutions (Q25R, Q40R, and P68T), with P68T generating a second N-linked glycosylation site (N66) in addition to an invariant N32 encoded by all chimpanzee CD4 alleles.

llo Abstract: T regulatory (Treg) cells play a role in the suppression of immune responses, thus serving to induce tolerance and control autoimmunity. Here, we explored whether Treg cells influence the immediate hypersensitivity response of mast cells (MCs). Treg cells directly inhibited the FcvarepsilonRI-dependent MC degranulation through cell-cell contact involving OX40-OX40L interactions between Treg cells and MCs, respectively.

ed the FcvarepsilonRI-dependent MC degranulation through cell-cell contact involving OX40-OX40L interactions between Treg cells and MCs, respectively. When activated in the presence of Treg cells, MCs showed increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and reduced Ca(2+) influx, independently of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma2 or Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Antagonism of cAMP in MCs reversed the inhibitory effects of Treg cells, restoring normal Ca(2+) responses and degranulation.

Importantly, the in vivo depletion or inactivation of Treg cells caused enhancement of the anaphylactic response. The demonstrated crosstalk between Treg cells and MCs defines a previously unrecognized mechanism controlling MC degranulation.

Central and effector memory CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to tumor-associated antigens. 2012 Authors: Stefano Caserta, Jessica Geraldine Borger, Rose Zamoyska Abstract: Harnessing T-cell responses to constrain tumor growth is a realistic treatment aspiration in tumor medicine, as many tumors express specific tumor associated antigens that are recognized by the adaptive immune system. CD8 T cells have direct cytolytic activity against tumor cells, and CD4 T cells mount a variety of responses that have important influences on tumor growth.

Here we present a mouse model of ascending UP infection that resembles human disease, using vaginal inoculation combined with mild cervical injury induced by a common spermicide (Nonoxynol-9, as a surrogate for any mechanism of cervical epithelial damage). We measure bacterial load in a non-invasive manner using a luciferase-expressing UP strain, and post-mortem by qPCR and bacterial titration.
