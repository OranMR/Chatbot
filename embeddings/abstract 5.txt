rico Sartori, Eliana Bignotti, Franco Odicino, Antonella Ravaggi Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a spectrum of different diseases, which makes their treatment a challenge. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is an oncogene aberrantly expressed in many solid cancers including serous EOC, but its role in non-serous EOCs remains undefined. We examined FOXM1 expression and its correlation to prognosis across the three major EOC subtypes, and its role in tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance in vitro.

FOXN1 in thymus organogenesis and development. 2016 Aug Authors: Harsh Jayesh Vaidya, Alberto Briones Leon, C Clare Blackburn Abstract: Development of the primary T-cell repertoire takes place in the thymus. The linked processes of T-cell differentiation and T-cell repertoire selection each depend on interactions between thymocytes and thymic stromal cells; in particular, with the epithelial cells of the cortical and medullary thymic compartments (cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells; cTECs and mTECs, respectively).

he epithelial cells of the cortical and medullary thymic compartments (cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells; cTECs and mTECs, respectively). The importance of the thymic epithelial cell lineage in these processes was revealed in part through analysis of nude (nu/nu) mice, which are congenitally hairless and athymic. The nude phenotype results from null mutation of the forkhead transcription factor FOXN1, which has emerged as a pivotal regulator both of thymus development and homeostasis.

We have generated a novel reporter of Foxn1 expression, Foxn1G, to monitor changes in Foxn1 expression during embryogenesis and involution. Our data reveal that early differentiation and maturation of cortical and medullary TEC coincides with precise sub-lineage-specific regulation of Foxn1 expression levels.

We further show that initiation of thymic involution is associated with reduced cTEC functionality, and proportional expansion of FOXN1-negative TEC in both cortical and medullary sub-lineages. Cortex-specific down-regulation of Foxn1 between 1 and 3 months of age may therefore be a key driver of the early stages of age-related thymic involution.

The food-borne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes serves as a model system for understanding how an environmental organism makes the transition into mammalian hosts. A transcriptional regulatory protein known as PrfA appears to serve as a critical switch, enabling L. monocytogenes to transition from the outside environment to life within the host cell cytosol.

Functional analysis of brain dopamine systems in a genetic mouse model of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. 1992 Nov Authors: H A Jinnah, P J Langlais, T Friedmann Abstract: The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by congenital deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The disorder is characterized by prominent neurobehavioral abnormalities which appear to result in part from dysfunction of striatal dopamine systems.

The disorder is characterized by prominent neurobehavioral abnormalities which appear to result in part from dysfunction of striatal dopamine systems. HPRT-deficient (HPRT-) mutant strains of mice have been produced as animal models for this syndrome, but these animals exhibit none of the neurobehavioral abnormalities seen in Lesch-Nyhan patients. The present studies describe the behavioral responses of three strains of mice carrying one of two mutations in the HPRT gene to agents which interact with brain dopamine systems.

This entails recognition of molecular patterns on host surfaces combined with control of one of nature's most dangerous examples of a positive-feedback loop. In this way, FH modulates, where and when needed, an amplification process that otherwise exponentially escalates the production of the pro-inflammatory, pro-phagocytic, and pro-cytolytic cleavage products of complement proteins C3 and C5.

Transient transfection and localization experiments in mammalian cells were combined with HSV-1 bacterial artificial chromosome mutagenesis to reveal the functional properties of the essential pUL34 TA. Our data show that a minimal tail length of 15 residues is sufficient for nuclear envelope targeting and pUL34 function.

However, gene knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) is being successfully used in schistosome and planarian species to define gene functions. Lessons from these systems may be applied to improve RNAi in H. contortus. Previous studies in H. contortus and related nematodes demonstrated reliable RNAi-mediated silencing of some genes, but not others.

Current data suggest that susceptibility to RNAi in these nematodes is limited to genes expressed in sites accessible to the environment, such as the gut, amphids and excretory cell. Therefore, RNAi is functional in H. contortus, but improvements are needed to develop this system as a functional genomics platform. Here, we summarize RNAi studies on H.

As has been reported for ORF10, ORF11 and ORF12 were dispensable for VZV replication in melanoma and human embryonic fibroblast cells. In contrast, deletion of ORF9 was incompatible with the recovery of infectious virus. ORF9 localized to the virion tegument and formed complexes with glycoprotein E, which is an essential protein, in VZV-infected cells.

Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified key HSC transcription factors as being upregulated upon geminin deletion, revealing a gene network linked with geminin that controls fetal hematopoiesis. In order to obtain mechanistic insight into the ability of geminin to regulate transcription, we examined Hoxa9 as an example of a key gene in definitive hematopoiesis.

Moreover, silencing geminin reduced recruitment of the PRC2 component SUZ12 to the HOXA9 locus and resulted in an increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), whereas the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were reduced. The chromatin landscape was also modified at the regulatory regions of HOXA10 and GATA1.

First, how is information integrated from many widely separated binding sites to determine how a gene is transcribed? Second, does the presence of multiple energy-expending mechanisms, which are absent from eubacterial genomes, indicate that eukaryotes are capable of improved forms of genetic information processing? An updated biophysical foundation is needed to answer such questions.

Although components of this pathway have been previously generated and studied in vitro, the assembly of this multi-synaptic circuit has not yet been achieved with human cells. Here, we derive organoids resembling the cerebral cortex or the hindbrain/spinal cord and assemble them with human skeletal muscle spheroids to generate 3D cortico-motor assembloids.

r objectives were to determine the feasibility of a concomitant genetic improvement programme for enhanced milk production and resistance to mastitis. Individual records for milk yield, and four mastitis-related traits (milk somatic cell count, California Mastitis Test score, total viable bacterial count in milk and clinical mastitis presence) were collected monthly throughout lactation for 609 ewes of the Chios breed. All ewes were genotyped with a mastitis specific custom-made 960 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.

Environmental factors appeared to favour both milk production and udder health. There were no overlapping of SNPs associated with mastitis resistance and milk yield in Chios sheep. Furthermore, four distinct Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) affecting milk yield were detected on chromosomes 2, 12, 16 and 19, in locations other than those previously identified to affect mastitis resistance.

Herein, we studied occurrence and genetic diversity of PCV2 in Thailand and their relationships to the global PCV2 based on ORF2 sequences. The results showed that 306 samples (44.09%) from 56 farms (80%) were PCV2 positive by PCR. Phylogenetic trees constructed by both neighbor-joining and Bayesian Inference yielded similar topology of the ORF2 sequences.

Thai PCV2 comprise four clusters: PCV2a (5.5%), PCV2b (29.41%), intermediate clade 1 (IM1) PCV2b (11.03%) and PCV2d (54.41%). Genetic shift of PCV2 in Thailand has occurred similarly to the global situation. The shift from PCV2b to PCV2d was clearly observed during 2013-2014. The viruses with genetically similar to the first reported PCV2 in 2004 have still circulated in Thailand.

ies of fungal, plant, and animal genomes have reported conflicting results regarding the direction in which these genomic features drive TE evolution. Many of these studies have had limited power, however, because they studied taxonomically narrow systems, comparing only a limited number of phylogenetically independent contrasts, and did not address long-term effects on TE evolution. Here, we test the long-term determinants of TE evolution by comparing 42 nematode genomes spanning over 500 million years of diversification.

This analysis includes numerous transitions between life history states, and RNAi pathways, and evaluates if these forces are sufficiently persistent to affect the long-term evolution of TE loads in eukaryotic genomes. Although we demonstrate statistical power to detect selection, we find no evidence that variation in these factors influence genomic TE loads across extended periods of time.

es. Previous studies with Methanococcus maripaludis demonstrated that NrpR binds to palindromic operator sequences, blocking transcription initiation. The metabolite 2-oxoglutarate, an indicator of cellular nitrogen deficiency, induces transcription by lowering the affinity of NrpR for operator DNA. In this report we build on existing genetic tools for M.

nitrogen deficiency, induces transcription by lowering the affinity of NrpR for operator DNA. In this report we build on existing genetic tools for M. maripaludis to develop a screen for change-of-function mutations in a transcriptional regulator and demonstrate the use of an X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside) screen for strict anaerobes. We use the approach to address the primary structural requirements for the response of NrpR to 2-oxoglutarate. nrpR genes from the mesophilic M.

obes. We use the approach to address the primary structural requirements for the response of NrpR to 2-oxoglutarate. nrpR genes from the mesophilic M. maripaludis and the hyperthermophilic Methanopyrus kandleri were targeted for mutagenesis. M. maripaludis nrpR encodes a protein with two homologous NrpR domains while the M. kandleri nrpR homolog encodes a single NrpR domain. Random point mutagenesis and alanine replacement mutagenesis identified two amino acid residues of M.

dleri nrpR homolog encodes a single NrpR domain. Random point mutagenesis and alanine replacement mutagenesis identified two amino acid residues of M. kandleri NrpR involved in induction of gene expression under nitrogen-deficient conditions and thus in the response to 2-oxoglutarate. Mutagenesis of the corresponding regions in either domain of M. maripaludis NrpR resulted in a similar effect, demonstrating a conserved structure-function relationship between the two repressors. The results indicate that in M.

This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes.

Lean T2D was defined as T2D patient with a body mass index (BMI) <23 kg/m, whereas obese T2D was defined as T2D patient with a BMI ‡28 kg/m. Twenty-five genome-wide association studies previously validated T2D-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. A genotype risk score (GRS) based on the 25 SNPs was created.

ugh DR is dependent on IR capability. Separating these components may be useful for deciphering the genetic variation in age-related memory abilities. This study was conducted to (a) construct individual trajectories in IR and independent aspects of delayed recall, or residualized-DR (rDR), across older adulthood; and (b) identify genetic markers that contribute to four estimated phenotypes: IR and rDR levels and changes after age 60. A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S.

A cognitively intact sample (N = 20,650 with 125,164 observations) was drawn from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of adults aged 50 and older. Mixed effects regression models were constructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996-2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR.

ructed using repeated measures from data collected every two years (1996-2012) to estimate level at age 60 and change in memory post-60 in IR and rDR. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) were conducted in the genotypic subsample (N = 7,486) using ~1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One SNP (rs2075650) in TOMM40 associated with rDR level at the genome-wide level (p = 5.0x10-08), an effect that replicated in an independent sample from the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (N = 6,898 with 41,328 observations).

The only animals retained were those present in a herd during episodes in which at least 2 animals showed evidence of infection; this ensured a high likelihood of exposure to M. bovis. Linear animal models, and sire and animal threshold models were used to estimate the variance components for susceptibility to M. bovis-purified protein derivative (PPD) responsiveness and confirmed M.

models were used to estimate the variance components for susceptibility to M. bovis-purified protein derivative (PPD) responsiveness and confirmed M. bovis infection. The heritability estimates from the threshold sire models were biased upward because the relatedness between dam-daughter pairs was ignored. The threshold animal model produced heritability estimates of 0.14 in cows and 0.12 in heifers for susceptibility to M. bovis-PPD responsiveness, and 0.18 in cows for confirmed M. bovis infection susceptibility.

0.14 in cows and 0.12 in heifers for susceptibility to M. bovis-PPD responsiveness, and 0.18 in cows for confirmed M. bovis infection susceptibility. Therefore, exploitable genetic variation exists among Irish dairy cows for susceptibility to M. bovis infection. Sire rankings from the linear and threshold animal models were similar, indicating that either model could be used for the analysis of susceptibility to M. bovis-PPD responsiveness. A favorable genetic correlation close to unity was observed between susceptibility to confirmed M.

Houston Abstract: The genetic architecture of complex traits in farmed animal populations is of interest from a scientific and practical perspective. The use of genetic markers to predict the genetic merit (breeding values) of individuals is commonplace in modern farm animal breeding schemes. Recently, high density SNP arrays have become available for Atlantic salmon, which facilitates genomic prediction and association studies using genome-wide markers and economically important traits.

The CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium undertook genome wide association meta-analysis for plasma cortisol in 12,597 Caucasian participants, replicated in 2,795 participants.

notypic and genotypic data were collected from two crossbred lamb populations: Texel x Scotch Mule (TxSM, n = 2330) and Texel x Lleyn (TxL, n = 3816). Traits measured included live weights at birth, eight weeks and weaning (~15 weeks). VIA-predicted traits included total weights and weights of fat, muscle and bone in the whole carcass and primal (hind leg, saddle, shoulder) regions. Within-breed heritabilities estimated for the VIA traits ranged from 0.01 to 0.70, indicating potential for inclusion of some traits in breeding programmes.

David Cesarini, Daniel J Benjamin, Philipp D Koellinger, Jonathan P Beauchamp Abstract: Humans vary substantially in their willingness to take risks. In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance.

ng, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated ([Formula: see text] ~ 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors.

east one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated ([Formula: see text] ~ 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.

Based on the radiographic examination, 162 horses were selected for genotyping; 80 of these were cases with an OCD at the intermediate ridge of the distal tibia, and 82 were controls without any developmental lesions in the joints examined. Genotyped horses descended from 22 sires, and the number of horses in each half-sib group ranged from 3 to 14.

We performed genome-wide association studies in up to 130,600 European ancestry participants overall, and stratified for key CKD risk factors. We uncovered 6 new loci in association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the primary clinical measure of CKD, in or near MPPED2, DDX1, SLC47A1, CDK12, CASP9, and INO80.

lal, Marc Vandeputte, Ross D Houston Abstract: European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is one of the most important species for European aquaculture. Viral nervous necrosis (VNN), commonly caused by the redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), can result in high levels of morbidity and mortality, mainly during the larval and juvenile stages of cultured sea bass. In the absence of efficient therapeutic treatments, selective breeding for host resistance offers a promising strategy to control this disease.

FEC for both Nematodirus and Strongyles nematodes (excluding Nematodirus), as well as body weight were collected at approximately 16, 20 and 24 weeks of age. In addition, a weighted average animal effect was estimated for both FEC and body weight traits. After quality control, 44 388 SNPs were available for the GWA analysis and 42 841 for the RHM, which utilises only mapped SNPs.

North, Caroline S Fox Abstract: Central obesity, measured by waist circumference (WC) or waist-hip ratio (WHR), is a marker of body fat distribution. Although obesity disproportionately affects minority populations, few studies have conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) of fat distribution among those of predominantly African ancestry (AA). We performed GWAS of WC and WHR, adjusted and unadjusted for BMI, in up to 33,591 and 27,350 AA individuals, respectively.

We identified loci associated with fat distribution in AA individuals using meta-analyses of GWA results for WC and WHR (stage 1). Overall, 25 SNPs with single genomic control (GC)-corrected p-values<5.0 × 10(-6) were followed-up (stage 2) in AA with WC and with WHR. Additionally, we interrogated genomic regions of previously identified European ancestry (EA) WHR loci among AA.

In joint analysis of association results including both Stage 1 and 2 cohorts, 2 SNPs demonstrated association, rs2075064 at LHX2, p = 2.24×10(-8) for WC-adjusted-for-BMI, and rs6931262 at RREB1, p = 2.48×10(-8) for WHR-adjusted-for-BMI. However, neither signal was genome-wide significant after double GC-correction (LHX2: p = 6.5 × 10(-8); RREB1: p = 5.7 × 10(-8)).

Finally, we observed nominal evidence for sexual dimorphism, with stronger results in AA women at the GRB14 locus (p for interaction = 0.02).

In conclusion, we identified two suggestive loci associated with fat distribution in AA populations in addition to confirming 6 loci previously identified in populations of EA. These findings reinforce the concept that there are fat distribution loci that are independent of generalized adiposity.

This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated.

Genome-wide characterization of insertion and deletion variation in chicken using next generation sequencing. 2014 Authors: Yiyuan Yan, Guoqiang Yi, Congjiao Sun, Lujiang Qu, Ning Yang Abstract: Insertion and deletion (INDEL) is one of the main events contributing to genetic and phenotypic diversity, which receives less attention than SNP and large structural variation. To gain a better knowledge of INDEL variation in chicken genome, we applied next generation sequencing on 12 diverse chicken breeds at an average effective depth of 8.6.

owledge of INDEL variation in chicken genome, we applied next generation sequencing on 12 diverse chicken breeds at an average effective depth of 8.6. Over 1.3 million non-redundant short INDELs (1-49 bp) were obtained, the vast majority (92.48%) of which were novel. Follow-up validation assays confirmed that most (88.00%) of the randomly selected INDELs represent true variations. The majority (95.76%) of INDELs were less than 10 bp. Both the detected number and affected bases were larger for deletions than insertions.

tions. In total, INDELs covered 3.8 Mbp, corresponding to 0.36% of the chicken genome. The average genomic INDEL density was estimated as 0.49 per kb. INDELs were ubiquitous and distributed in a non-uniform fashion across chromosomes, with lower INDEL density in micro-chromosomes than in others, and some functional regions like exons and UTRs were prone to less INDELs than introns and intergenic regions. Nearly 620,253 INDELs fell in genic regions, 1,765 (0.28%) of which located in exons, spanning 1,358 (7.56%) unique Ensembl genes.

Many of them are associated with economically important traits and some are the homologues of human disease-related genes. We demonstrate that sequencing multiple individuals at a medium depth offers a promising way for reliable identification of INDELs. The coding INDELs are valuable candidates for further elucidation of the association between genotypes and phenotypes.

opmental forms of the parasite exist: proliferative 'slender' forms and arrested 'stumpy' forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring both infection chronicity and disease transmission. This response is triggered by an elusive 'stumpy induction factor' (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway is also uncharacterized.

Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling components driving stumpy formation.

imicrobial peptide polymyxin B. We identified 78 genes and several diverse pathways whose interruption alters <i>S. meliloti</i> resistance to NCR247. These genes encode the following: (i) cell envelope polysaccharide biosynthesis and modification proteins, (ii) inner and outer membrane proteins, (iii) peptidoglycan (PG) effector proteins, and (iv) non-membrane-associated factors such as transcriptional regulators and ribosome-associated factors. We describe a previously uncharacterized yet highly conserved peptidase, which protects <i>S.

s in poultry production was recently banned in the EU, increasing the need for alternative methods to control Salmonella infections in poultry flocks. Genetic selection of chickens more resistant to Salmonella colonization provides an attractive means of sustainably controlling the pathogen in commercial poultry flocks and its subsequent entry into the food chain. Analysis of different inbred chickens has shown that individual lines are consistently either susceptible or resistant to the many serovars of Salmonella that have been tested.

In this study, two inbred chicken lines with differential susceptibility to Salmonella colonization (61 ((R)) and N((S)) ) were used in a backcross experimental design. Unlike previous studies that used a candidate gene approach or low-density genome-wide screens, we have exploited a high-density marker set of 1255 SNPs covering the whole genome to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL).

In contrast, CC23, including its namesake ST23, has been associated with a wide homeothermic and poikilothermic host range, but never with fish. The aim of this study was to determine whether ST23 is virulent in fish and to identify genomic markers of fish adaptation of S. agalactiae.

Intraperitoneal challenge of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus), showed that ST260 is lethal at doses down to 10(2) cfu per fish, whereas ST23 does not cause disease at 10(7) cfu per fish. Comparison of the genome sequence of ST260 and ST23 with those of strains derived from fish, cattle and humans revealed the presence of genomic elements that are unique to subpopulations of S.

Human neonatal studies are challenging, and elucidating host protective responses and underlying cognate pathway biology, in the context of viral infection in early life, remains to be fully explored.

ating host protective responses and underlying cognate pathway biology, in the context of viral infection in early life, remains to be fully explored. In both resource rich and poor settings, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital infection. By using unbiased systems analyses of transcriptomic resources for HCMV neonatal infection, we find the systemic response of a preterm congenital HCMV infection, involves a focused IFN regulatory response associated with dendritic cells.

Giardia duodenalis in the UK: current knowledge of risk factors and public health implications. 2019 Apr Authors: B Horton, H Bridle, C L Alexander, F Katzer Abstract: Giardia duodenalis is a ubiquitous flagellated protozoan parasite known to cause giardiasis throughout the world. Potential transmission vehicles for this zoonotic parasite are both water and food sources. As such consumption of water contaminated by feces, or food sources washed in contaminated water containing parasite cysts, may result in outbreaks.

The hospital admission rate increased with advancing age and was higher in men. The total disease burden was likely underestimated when using the definition of radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Based on data from 52 hospital studies reporting data on pneumonia mortality, we estimated that about 1.1 million in-hospital deaths (UR, 0.9-1.4 in-hospital deaths) occurred among older adults.

The USA acts as the primary hub of temperate transmission and, together with China and Southeast Asia, forms the trunk of influenza's evolutionary tree. These findings suggest that antiviral use outside of China and Southeast Asia may lead to the evolution of long-term local and potentially global antiviral resistance.

2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exposed major gaps in our knowledge of the global spatial ecology and evolution of influenza A viruses in swine (swIAVs). Here we undertake an expansive phylogenetic analysis of swIAV sequence data and demonstrate that the global live swine trade strongly predicts the spatial dissemination of swIAVs, with Europe and North America acting as sources of viruses in Asian countries.

gG glycosylation in 5,117 individuals from four European populations, we have revealed very complex patterns of changes in IgG glycosylation with age. Several IgG glycans (including FA2B, FA2G2, and FA2BG2) changed considerably with age and the combination of these three glycans can explain up to 58% of variance in chronological age, significantly more than other markers of biological age like telomere lengths. The remaining variance in these glycans strongly correlated with physiological parameters associated with biological age.

Considering the important role of IgG glycans in inflammation, and because the observed changes with age promote inflammation, changes in IgG glycosylation also seem to represent a factor contributing to aging.

Order O(N)-dimensional gradient calculations based on the standard pruning algorithm require O(N2) operations, where N is the number of sampled molecular sequences. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, recent phylogenetic studies have analyzed hundreds to thousands of sequences, with an apparent trend toward even larger data sets as a result of advancing technology.

GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation in the plant defence response. 2011 Nov Authors: Saad I Malik, Adil Hussain, Byung-Wook Yun, Steven H Spoel, Gary J Loake Abstract: A key feature of the plant defence response is the transient engagement of a nitrosative burst, resulting in the synthesis of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs). Specific, highly reactive cysteine (Cys) residues of low pK(a) are a major site of action for these intermediates. The addition of an NO moiety to a Cys thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO), is termed S-nitrosylation.

amine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting.

ndividual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway.

approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for <i>bona fide</i> autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide.

Guides to the final frontier of the cytoskeleton: septins in filamentous fungi. 2010 Dec Authors: Amy S Gladfelter Abstract: Recent investigations have established core principles by which septins can form non-polar filaments in vitro. How cells then assemble, regulate and use septin polymers is still only beginning to be understood. It is clear that there is plasticity and variability in septin organization across diverse species and cell types.

ll only beginning to be understood. It is clear that there is plasticity and variability in septin organization across diverse species and cell types. Work in the filamentous fungi has been invaluable in discovering this variation in form and function. In particular filamentous fungi display many forms of higher order septin structures and study of septins in these systems has led to insights into septin assembly, dynamics and regulation.

many forms of higher order septin structures and study of septins in these systems has led to insights into septin assembly, dynamics and regulation. Importantly in many cases work in these alternative systems reveal differences to how septins may be organized, functioning or regulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here I review the novel aspects of septin biology found in filamentous fungi and raise many open questions about these enigmatic polymers that should guide future study.

bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) prions are faithfully maintained upon transmission to guinea pigs. However, primary and secondary transmissions of BSE and vCJD in guinea pigs result in long incubation periods of ~450 and ~350 days, respectively. To determine if the incubation periods of BSE and vCJD prions could be shortened, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing guinea pig prion protein (GPPrP).

ne if the incubation periods of BSE and vCJD prions could be shortened, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing guinea pig prion protein (GPPrP). Inoculation of Tg(GPPrP) mice with BSE and vCJD prions resulted in mean incubation periods of 210 and 199 days, respectively, which shortened to 137 and 122 days upon serial transmission. In contrast, three different isolates of sporadic CJD prions failed to transmit disease to Tg(GPPrP) mice.

137 and 122 days upon serial transmission. In contrast, three different isolates of sporadic CJD prions failed to transmit disease to Tg(GPPrP) mice. Many of the strain-specified biochemical and neuropathological properties of BSE and vCJD prions, including the presence of type 2 protease-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, were preserved upon propagation in Tg(GPPrP) mice.

ructural modeling revealed that two residues near the N-terminal region of a-helix 1 in GPPrP might mediate its susceptibility to BSE and vCJD prions. Our results demonstrate that expression of GPPrP in Tg mice supports the rapid propagation of BSE and vCJD prions and suggest that Tg(GPPrP) mice may serve as a useful paradigm for bioassaying these prion isolates.

SCFAs sodium acetate, neutrophil apoptosis and FABP4 expression were further analyzed. Then, FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 was used to treat neutrophils. We found CLP group had increased lung injury score, lung tissue wet/dry ratio, lung vascular permeability, and inflammatory factors IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, IFN-g, and CCL3 levels in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Additionally, FABP4 was lower in neutrophils of ARDS patients and mice. Meanwhile, CLP-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota and changes in SCFAs levels were observed.

ABP4 was lower in neutrophils of ARDS patients and mice. Meanwhile, CLP-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota and changes in SCFAs levels were observed. Further verification showed that acetic acids reduced neutrophil apoptosis and FABP4 expression via FFAR2. Besides, FABP4 affected neutrophil apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and neutrophil depletion alleviated the promotion of ARDS development by BMS309403. Moreover, FABP4 in neutrophils regulated the injury of RLE-6TN through inflammatory factors.

DAMPs such as calprotectin (S100A8/9) have an established clinical role as a biomarker in IBD. In this review, we use IBD as an archetypal common chronic inflammatory disease to focus on the conceptual and evidential importance of DAMPs in pathogenesis and why DAMPs represent an entirely new class of targets for clinical translation.

Globally, it is one of the most frequent causes of acute viral hepatitis. The majority of HEV infections are asymptomatic and lead to the spontaneous clearance of the virus.

the most frequent causes of acute viral hepatitis. The majority of HEV infections are asymptomatic and lead to the spontaneous clearance of the virus. Among the eight different genotypes identified to date, HEV genotype 1 (HEV1), HEV2, HEV3, and HEV4 are the most frequent genotypes causing infections in humans. HEV1 and HEV2 are prevalent in developing regions and able to result in large-scale outbreaks originating from contaminated water supplies. They are also responsible for severe hepatitis in pregnant patients and infants.

In contrast, HEV3 and HEV4 are zoonotic, and the transmission of these genotypes to humans occurs mainly through the fecal contamination of water and consumption of contaminated meat from infected animals.

In the clinical perspective, HEV infections have diverse clinical manifestations including acute and self-limiting hepatitis, acute-on-chronic liver disease, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Although HEV mainly results in acute self-limiting infection, chronic HEV infection may occur among immunocompromised patients (<i>e.g</i>., solid-organ transplant recipients).

ndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) life cycle is the binding of the spike (S) protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) host cell receptor. Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

s for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility.

the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an "up" and "down" state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a "bouncing spring" that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor.

We recently showed that the emerging macrolide resistance in the soilborne equine and zoonotic pathogen <i>Rhodococcus equi</i> is conferred by the <i>erm</i>(46) gene carried on the 87-kb conjugative plasmid pRErm46. Here, we investigated the conjugal transferability of pRErm46 to 14 representative bacteria likely encountered by <i>R. equi</i> in the environmental habitat.

Infected mice were treated with 330 nmol of crude papaya latex or with 240 nmol of papaya latex supernatant (PLS). Wide variation of response between different mouse strains was detected. Treatment was most effective in C3H (90·5-99·3% reduction in worm counts) and least effective in CD1 and BALB/c strains (36·0 and 40·5%, respectively).

The main objectives of this work were to validate the use of S/P ratio as an indicator trait to select pigs during a PRRS outbreak and to explore the genetic basis of antibody response to PRRSV. Farrowing data included 2,546 and 2,522 litters from 894 Duroc and 813 Landrace sows, respectively, split into pre-PRRS, PRRS, and post-PRRS phases.

Blood samples were taken from 1,231 purebred sows (541 Landrace and 690 Duroc) following a PRRS outbreak for subsequent PRRSV ELISA analysis for S/P ratio measurement. All animals had high-density genotype data available (29,799 single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs).

Heritability estimates (± standard error) of S/P ratio during the PRRS outbreak were moderate, with 0.35 ± 0.08 for Duroc and 0.34 ± 0.09 for Landrace. During the PRRS outbreak, favorable genetic correlations of S/P ratio with the number of piglets born alive (0.61 ± 0.34), number of piglets born dead (-0.33 ± 0.32), and number of stillborn piglets (-0.27 ± 0.31) were observed for Landrace sows.

For Duroc, the GWAS identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome (Chr) 7 (24-15 megabases; Mb) explaining 15% of the total genetic variance accounted for by markers (TGVM), and another one on Chr 8 (25 Mb) explaining 2.4% of TGVM.
