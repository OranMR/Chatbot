Several novel porcine bocaviruses (PBoVs) have been identiﬁed in pigs in recent years and association of
-based
these viruses with respiratory signs or diarrhea has been suggested. In this study, an EvaGreen
multiplex real-time PCR (EG-mPCR) with melting curve analysis was developed for simultaneous
detection and grouping of novel PBoVs into the same genogroups G1, G2 and G3. Each target produced a
speciﬁc amplicon with a

Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
melting peak of 81.3 ± 0.34 (cid:1)C for PBoV G1, 78.2 ± 0.37 (cid:1)C for PBoV G2, and
85.0 ± 0.29 (cid:1)C for PBoV G3. Non-speciﬁc reactions were not observed when other pig viruses were used
to assess the EG-mPCR assay. The sensitivity of the EG-mPCR assay using puriﬁed plasmid constructs
containing the speciﬁc viral target fragments was 100 copies for PBoV G1, 50 for PBoV G2 and 100 for
PBoV G3. The assay is able to detect and distinguish three PBoV groups with intra-assay and

variations ranging from 0.13 to 1.59%. The newly established EG-mPCR assay was validated with 227 ﬁeld
samples from pigs. PBoV G1, G2 and G3 was detected in 15.0%, 25.1% and 41.9% of the investigated
samples and coinfections of two or three PBoV groups were also detected in 25.1% of the cases, indicating
that all PBoV groups are prevalent in Chinese pigs. The agreement of the EG-mPCR assay with an
EvaGreen-based singleplex real-time PCR (EG-sPCR) assay was 99.1%. This EG-mPCR will

serve as a rapid,
sensitive, reliable and cost effective alternative for routine surveillance testing of multiple PBoVs in pigs
and will enhance our understanding of the epidemiological features and possible also pathogenetic
changes associated with these viruses in pigs.

1. Introduction

Porcine bocavirus (PboV) is a recently discovered virus, which
obtained its main name, bocavirus after its ﬁrst known hosts
(bovine and canine) [1,2]. PBoV belongs
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
to the Bocavirus genus in
the Parvovirinae subfamily of Parvoviridae family, which is a group
of divergent non-enveloped linear single stranded DNA viruses
with a genome of approximately 5000 nucleotides comprising an
open reading frame (ORF) encoding for non-structural protein NS1
at the 50 end and an ORF at the 30 end encoding for the capsid
proteins VP1 and VP2 [3]. Bocavirus, distinguished from other

parvoviruses by the presence of an additional third major ORF
encoding for NP1 of unknown function located in the middle of the
viral genome, is known to infect numerous mammalian species
including humans, bovine, pigs, gorillas, chimpanzees,

sea lions, dogs, cats, bats and pine martens [4,5]. Members of this
genus, such as bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus which
represent two initially identiﬁed viruses in this genus, are patho-
gens that can cause respiratory or enteric disease in their hosts [6].
A recent research strongly supported that the human bocavirus
(HBoV) can also be associated with severe acute respiratory tract
infection in children in the absence of other viral and bacterial co-
infections [7]. The
----

recently discovered novel PBoV was also sug-
gested to be associated with respiratory signs or diarrhea, although
the pathogenicity of PBoV has not yet been recognized clearly [8,9].
Of these bocaviruses, PBoVs exhibit the most genetic diversity
[6,10,11]. Since the initial discovery of PBoV in Swedish pigs with
post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in 2009, a

number of additional PBoV has been subsequently
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
discovered and
characterized worldwide, and at least 17 novel PBoV species
including PBoV1 to PBoV5, PBoV strain WUH1, PBoV H18, PBoV2 A6,
PBoV3 22, PboV4 F41, PboV 3C and six newly identiﬁed USA strains
were identiﬁed to date by genome-sequence studies according to
the existing criteria for bocavirus classiﬁcation by the International
Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.ictvdb.org) [5,11].
Furthermore, mixed infections of a pig with multiple PBoV have
been reported in these studies.
----

Thus, it is necessary to develop an
effective and accurate approach to detect PBoV but also to differ-
entiate PBoV species for epidemiological surveillance and to deter-
mine potential associations between PBoV and related diseases.

Although random ampliﬁcation and large-scale sequencing
techniques (viral metagenomic analysis), followed by bioinfor-
matics analysis of large numbers of the sequences of the resulting
clones were used in recent years to discover novel PBoVs including
the ﬁrst

PBoV [4,6,12], these methods are not suitable for epide-
miological surveillance on routine sample submissions. Virus
isolation combined with electron microscopy or indirect immu-
noﬂuorescence assay, as a standard laboratory method for diag-
nosis of viral diseases, was developed to screen pig serum samples
for PBoV3 and PBoV4, however, this methodology was either not
sensitive or speciﬁc [13]. The PCR is an alternative rapid virus
detection method and several single PCR-based assays have
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
been
reported for sensitive and rapid detection of PBoV in clinical sam-
ples. However, these methods often just focused on one species or
could not cover all the species that have been discovered so far
[8e10,14]. Multiplex methods for the simultaneous detection of
several targets offer increased test capacity and reduce overall cost
and time, which is desirable for swine disease surveillance. Cai et al.
(2013) established a duplex PCR method to simultaneously detect
PBoV1, PBoV 2 and
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
PBoV3/PBoV4/PBoV5, but it was not sensitive
and also covered limited species [15]. In order to detect all known
PBoV species infecting pigs in clinical samples, a multiplex real-
time PCR assay has been recently described [5]. This method was
speciﬁc and sensitive for simultaneous detection and discrimina-
tion of all PBoVs that were classiﬁed into three groups (PBoV G1, G2,
and G3). However, TaqMan probes are expensive and time-
consuming to synthesize, and high potential false-negative
----

rates
have been reported for TaqMan assays due to sequence variability
within the probe-binding site [16,17].

In this study, we have developed an EvaGreen

-based multiplex
real-time PCR (EG-mPCR) assay followed by melting curve analysis
for simultaneous detection of all the different species of PBoV,
allowing a rapid, sensitive and speciﬁc diagnosis of PBoV infection
including of identiﬁcation of the viral species involved.

MN307 (KF025391), PBoV G2 stain IA147
(KF025392) and PBoV G3 strain IA270 (KF025390) were maintained
in the authors’ laboratory. To test speciﬁcity of the assay, the
transmissible
following non-targeted viruses were utilized:
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV) vaccine strain (No. 030718, Harbin Weike Biotechnology
development Company, Harbin, China), classical swine fever virus
(CSFV)
(Hangzhou strain), porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1,
EF533941), porcine

circovirus type 2 (PCV2, GQ996404) and
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV,
DQ269472) were maintained in the authors’ laboratory.

A total of 227 pig samples collected from different pig farms in
several provinces of China during the period from 2013 to 2014
were used in this study. The samples included 200 faecal samples

from clinically normal pigs located in the Zhejiang Province and
collected during 2013 and 22 healthy serum samples and 5 lung
samples from pigs
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
suffered from respiratory tract symptoms and
reproductive failure collected from 2013 to 2014. The samples were
stored at (cid:3)80 (cid:1)C until testing. The animal experiments were per-
formed in accordance with international standards for animal
welfare and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University.

2.2. Primers design

All of the genomic sequences of the PBoVs utilized in this study
were derived from GenBank nucleotide sequence
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
database. The
highly conserved regions within each PBoV group genome were
aligned with Clustal W (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA) (Fig. 1).
Primers corresponding to the conserved regions of the viral ge-
nomes were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 (Primer Biosoft
International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Three pairs of primers were
designed to amplify PBoV G1, G2 and G3 for the conventional PCR
and standard plasmid template construction (Table 1). Another
three pairs of primers were selected within

the range of the
amplicons that were capable to amplify and differentiate three
PBoV groups with respective distinct amplicon Tm values by
melting curve analysis in an EG-mPCR reaction (Table 1). The
speciﬁcity of the primers was conﬁrmed against random nucleotide
sequences obtained by a BLAST search in GenBank databases from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). All
primers were obtained from a commercial source (Sangon Biotech.
Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).

The samples were processed as described previously [5]. Brieﬂy,
tissue samples were minced and diluted 1:10 (w/v) in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium, homogenized and centrifuged at 1500g
for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. Faecal samples were resus-
pended 1:10 (w/v) in PBS, vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at
1500g for 10 min. Viral genomic DNA was extracted from frozen
clinical samples using the AxyPrep™ Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA
Miniprep Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China)

according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was stored at (cid:3)80 (cid:1)C
until usage.

2.4. Plasmid template construction

The PCR reactions for PBoV G1, G2 and G3 were conducted in a
25 mL mixture and included 2.5 mL 10 (cid:4) PCR buffer, 1.2 mL 2.5 mM of
each dNTPs, 2.5 mL 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mL of each 10 mM primer
(Table 1), 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/mL) (Sangon), 2 mL of the
DNA and 16 mL distilled water. The ampliﬁcations were performed
in a thermal cycler

(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) under
the following conditions: after initial denaturation at 95 (cid:1)C for
3 min, 35 cycles were conducted at 94 (cid:1)C for 30 s, 56 (cid:1)C for 30 s and
72 (cid:1)C for 30 s, followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72 (cid:1)C for 10 min. The
amplicons were detected by electrophoresing 5 mL aliquots through
1.5% agarose gel in 1 (cid:4) TAE (40 mM Tris-aceate [pH 8.0], 1 mM
EDTA). Each speciﬁc viral target fragment was cloned into the

EG-mPCR was carried out in 25 mL of the reaction mixture con-
taining 2.5 mL of 10 (cid:4) PCR Buffer and 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTP
mix, 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, 1.25 mL of 20 (cid:4) EG, 0.24 (PBoV G1),
0.64 (PBoV G2) and 0.12 (PBoV G3) mM of each primer pair, and 2 mL
each of plasmid DNA. The ampliﬁcation and quantiﬁcation were
performed under the following conditions: 5 min at 95 (cid:1)C, followed
by 40 cycles of 95 (cid:1)C for 15 s, 60 (cid:1)C for 15 s and 72 (cid:1)C for

30 s.
Melting curve analysis was conducted after each run under the
following conditions: The reaction mix was cooled at 60 (cid:1)C for

1 min and then heated at 95 (cid:1)C for 15 s in the ABI 7300 machine.
Fluorescence was continuously measured and the melting peaks
were calculated by plotting the negative derivative of ﬂuorescence
over temperature versus temperature (-dF/dT versus T). The
melting peak was deﬁned as melting temperature (Tm value),
which was analyzed to distinguish speciﬁc

by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

Initially, available nucleotide sequences of PBoVs were aligned
by the Clustal W method and a phylogenetic tree of PBoVs was
constructed based on partial and complete or nearly complete ge-

three groups (PBoV G1, G2 and G3)
(Fig. S1). Although the sequences displayed low similarity between
groups, the PBoV sequences within each group were found to be
relatively conserved (Fig. 1), and speciﬁc primers targeting each
PBoV group were successfully designed for conventional and real-
time PCRs (Table 1).

3.2. Speciﬁcity detection of PBoV G1, G2 and G3 in the EG-mPCR
assay

To determine the speciﬁcity of the assay, the three targeted and
all non-targeted viruses were tested with the

EG-mPCR assay.
Three discriminated melting peaks for each PBoV group were
generated from amplicons after melting curve analysis, while no
speciﬁc ampliﬁcation was detected with the other non-targeted pig
viruses including PCV1, PCV2, PRRSV, CSFV, TGEV and PEDV,
although lower melting peaks formed by slight primer dimers were
observed (Fig 2A). When all three targeted PBoV groups were tested
in the same reaction, three targets were discriminated by three
distinct melting peaks through melt curve

analysis followed by
mPCR ampliﬁcation, with Tm values of 81.3 ± 0.34 (cid:1)C for PBoV G1,
78.2 ± 0.37 (cid:1)C for PBoV G2, and 85.0 ± 0.29 (cid:1)C for PBoV G3 (Fig. 2B).
In addition, the speciﬁc ampliﬁcations were also conﬁrmed by
electrophoresis with a 3% agarose gel (data not shown). These re-
sults demonstrated that the EG-mPCR was speciﬁc for detection
and differentiation of the three PBoV groups.

The sensitivity of the EG-mPCR

assay was performed by testing
serial dilutions of known concentrations of standard plasmid DNAs,
and the standard curve was constructed using threshold cycles (Ct)
and log inputs for various DNA concentrations ranging from
1.0 (cid:4) 102 copies/mL to 1.0 (cid:4) 107 copies/mL with 10-fold serial di-
lutions to calculate efﬁciency. The minimum plasmid concentration
with a positive result was 100 copies/mL (PBoV G1), 50 copies/mL
(PBoV G2), and 100 copies/mL (PBoV G3) (Fig. 3), and the

ampliﬁ-
cation efﬁciency of PBoV G1, G2 and G3 was 0.986, 1.027 and 1.067
respectively, demonstrating a satisfactory state of ampliﬁcation. To
simulate the infection status of the three PBoV groups in the actual
ﬁeld setting, various template combinations were chosen to
determine the sensitivity of the assay. When one PBoV group was
present at 1.0 (cid:4) 106 copies/mL, the detection limit for PBoV G1, PBoV
G2 and PBoV G3 was 500, 250 and 250 copies/mL respectively, and
250, 250 and 100

Intra and inter-assay reproducibility of the EG-mPCR assay

Intra- and inter-test repeatability of the Tm-based method were
performed in triplicate for each dilution within the same run and
each concentration was repeated at three different times to assess
the EG-mPCR assay. The intra-assay

group was low with a coefﬁcient of variation (CV) from
0.15 to 1.59%. The inter-assay variability of CV for Tm value was also
low, in the range of 0.17e1.73%(Table 2). Less than 2.0% CV among
intra- and inter-tests demonstrated a good repeatability of the
assay.

3.5. Application of the EG-mPCR assay for clinical samples

To assess the EG-mPCR for diagnosis of PBoVs, 227 clinical
specimens were tested for all three PBoV groups G1, G2 and G3 by
the EG-mPCR and the EG-sPCR using the same three
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
sets of primers
(Table 3). Among the 227 clinical samples, 15.0%, 25.1% and 41.9%
were positive for PBoV G1, G2 and G3 by the EG-mPCR. A total of
124 samples were positive with the EG-sPCR. The coincidence be-
tween the two diagnostic methods was 99.1%.

In addition, mixed infection of PBoV G1 and G2 was found in
3.1% of the samples, PBoV G1 and G3 in 5.7%, PBoV G2 and G3 in
13.2%, and all three PBoV groups were detected in 3.1% of the 227
samples when tested with the EG-mPCR assay. The
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
positive sam-
ples were conﬁrmed by sequencing and all the sequences obtained
clustered in their respective groups by phylogenetic analysis. These
results indicated that the EG-mPCR could be applied for detection
and differentiation of the three PBoV groups in clinical samples and
for epidemiological investigation.

4. Discussion

Since its discovery in 2009, PBoV has been detected globally. To
date, eleven countries have reported infections of PBoV, although
the frequency of the reported
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
infections varied from country to
country [18e21]. PBoV G1 was found to be almost twice as preva-
lent in pigs affected by porcine circovirus associated disease
(PCVAD) than in non-PCVAD pigs in Sweden from 2003 to 2007
[22]. A similar trend was also found in Chinese pigs [8,9], indicating
that PBoV G1 might have close relationship with swine respiratory
tract diseases, while no signiﬁcant difference was noted in the
detection rate for PBoV G3A and PBoV G3B in fecal or lung samples
from healthy
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
and diseased pigs [14]. Similarly, human BoV1
(HBoV1) is known to be a respiratory pathogen, while HBoV2-
HBoV4 are likely putative agents causing gastroenteritis [23]. The
ﬁndings in humans suggest that potential associations between
PBoVs and related diseases may exist. It is therefore important to
develop an effective and reliable method to demonstrate multiple
PBoV species or genotypes with one single assay for epidemiolog-
ical surveillance and disease management of PBoV.

In the present

study, all currently available partial and complete
or nearly complete genome sequences that have been deposited in
GenBank were aligned and phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV
feld into three distinct genetic lineages, thus generating three

bocavirus groups designated PBoV G1, G2 and G3 based on the
earliest dates of publications describing the ﬁrst members of these
clusters. This classiﬁcation is in agreement with previous studies
[4,5,24]. Despite the high genetic diversity observed in
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
PBoV, the
sequences within each group are relatively conserved and
designing a speciﬁc primer targeting each group is possible. The
EG-mPCR assay was developed based on the melting curve analysis
of different amplicons for each PBoV group using an EvaGreen
dye
with a distinct melting temperature (Tm) for each speciﬁc melting
peak. The ﬁnal Tm values of
the three PBoV groups were
81.3 ± 0.34 (cid:1)C, 78.2 ± 0.37 (cid:1)C and 85.0 ± 0.29 (cid:1)C, respectively, which
can be easily differentiated
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
from each other and used for identiﬁ-
cation of each PBoV group. The assay did not generate any speciﬁc
melting peak when non targeted pig viruses and a blank control
were tested which is suggestive of good speciﬁcity. Despite small
melt peaks corresponding to primer dimer observed in this study,
which was believed to occur even under optimal conditions
regardless of primer design and primer complementarity [25],
these small melt peaks could be easily discriminated from the
target amplicons
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
because of a lower Tm value and signal strength.
Furthermore, sequencing the positive samples conﬁrmed the
speciﬁcity of the assay.

High sensitivity is important for diagnostic tools. The EG-mPCR
assay described here could detect as few as 100 copies/mL for PBoV
G1, 50 copies/mL for PBoV G2 and 100 copies/mL for PBoV G3,
although slight primer dimers were observed in some cases, which
may affect the assay sensitivity. The assay was more sensitive than
conventional PCR assays which were
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
reported to have a detection
limit of around 105 copies/mL for PBoV [15], and even compared
with TaqMan based real time PCR which had detection limit of
600 copies/mL for PBoV2 [5]. Similar sensitivities for EG-mPCR as-
says were also reported previously for simultaneous detection of
six pig viruses with detection limits ranging from 100 to
500 copies/mL [26]. Under ﬁeld conditions, pigs can be co-infected
with certain PBoV groups [5]. To account for this, four mixed
combinations were chosen to
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
further validate the sensitivity of the
EG-mPCR assay. The sensitivity of three PBoV groups decreased
with the limits of detection ranging from 250 to 500 copies/mL
when combined with one or two groups. It is notable that with one
PBoV group present at a ﬁxed concentration of 1.0 (cid:4) 106 copies/mL
the detection limit for PBoV G1 or G3 was higher than that with
three PBoV groups mixed in the same concentrations (Fig. 3). This
may be caused by multiple targets competing for enzymes
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
and
nucleotides, interaction of primers with each other and interfer-
ence with each other of different melt peaks when co-
ampliﬁcations are performed in one tube, as was also observed in
a previous study [26]. Nevertheless, the assay was still comparable
to probe-based multiplex real-time PCRs which had a detection
limit around 102 copies/mL [27,28]. In addition, the EG-mPCR is
highly repeatable with both intra-assay and inter-assay variation
within 2%. These data demonstrated a good

speciﬁcity, sensitivity,
repeatability of the EG-mPCR assay.

The established EG-mPCR assay was then applied to the detec-
tion of PBoV present in clinical samples from pigs. Among 227
clinical samples, a total prevalence of 53.7% was detected for PBoV
by the EG-mPCR, of which 99.1% of the positive results were in
agreement with the EG-sPCR assay. Among the PBoV groups, PBoV
G3 had the highest overall prevalence of 41.9% and PBoV G1 had the
lowest overall prevalence of 15.0%. The relative ratio
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
of the detec-
tion rates for the three PBoV groups was similar to the relative size
of three branches in the phylogenetic tree (PBoV G3 branch > PBoV
G2 branch > PBoV G1 branch), although most of porcine samples
examined in this study were from faeces, mainly considering ease if
collection of this sample type and a higher assumed prevalence rate
in faecal samples compare with other sample types [14]. Our

ﬁndings were similar to the prevalence of PBoV groups or sub-
groups ranging from 17.2 to 43.1% in American pig herds [5].
Interestingly, while a higher prevalence rate of PBoV (81.8%) was
detected in serum samples from healthy pigs in this study
compared with 21.3% in serum samples from clinical US pigs and
40% in healthy Chinese pigs [29], the former did not detect any
PBoV G1, and the latter two just
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
identiﬁed PBoV G1 and/or G2.
Nevertheless, high prevalent rate of these viruses were detected in
this study in porcine faecal, lung, serum samples, although most of
which were from porcine faeces which was also the most frequent
sample type tested, suggesting a wide tissue tropism of these vi-
ruses [5,10,14].

Lau et al. ﬁrst reported a Hong Kong pig infected with two
subtypes of PBoV G3 (PBoV4-1 and PBoV4-2) [14]. Recent research
indicated that co-infection with multiple different
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
sequences
belonging to the same or different PBoV group(s) in the same
sample type was a common ﬁnding in swine herds in the USA and
in China [5,30]. In the current study, mixed infections of PBoV G1
and G2, PBoV G1 and G3, PBoV G2 and G3 and PBoV G1, G2 and G3
were detected in 3.1%, 5.7%, 13.2% and 3.1% of 227 samples,
respectively. Recombination, as an integral part of the evolution of
many viruses, has been reported within the Parvoviridae viral
family [31,32]. The high rate of coinfections
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
of distinct PBoVs in the
same sample may indicate ongoing viral transmission from multi-
ple sources and therefore may potentially facilitate recombination
and accelerate viral evolution. These ﬁndings suggest that these
viruses are in the process of adaptation and can undergo rapid
evolution to generate new genotypes or species. This is further
supported that PBoV have been identiﬁed as having the highest
genetic diversity among parvoviruses [5,6,10].

In summary, the EG-mPCR assays described
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0890850816300299-main.pdf
here provides an
alternative tool for simultaneous, rapid, sensitive and low-cost
detection of PBoV G1, G2 and G3 in swine for epidemiological
surveillance, which could help to better understand evolutionary
characteristics, epidemiology and disease association of PBoVs.

study examining patterns of AMR in Escherichia coli isolates circulating in sympatric human ( n = 321) and 
livestock ( n = 633) samples from 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya. E. coli isolates were tested for sus- 
ceptibility to 13 antimicrobial drugs representing nine antibiotic classes. High rates of AMR were detected, 
with 47.6% and 21.1% of isolates displaying resistance to three or more and ﬁve or more antibiotic classes, 
respectively. Human isolates showed higher

levels of resistance to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, aminogly-

tetracyclines ( P = 0.01) compared with humans. The most common co-resistant phenotype observed was 
to tetracyclines, streptomycin and trimethoprim (30.5%). At the household level, AMR carriage in humans 
was associated with human density ( P < 0.01) and the presence of livestock manure ( P = 0.03), but keeping 
livestock had

no inﬂuence on human AMR carriage ( P > 0.05). These ﬁndings revealed a high prevalence 
of AMR E. coli circulating in healthy humans and livestock in Nairobi, with no evidence to suggest that 
keeping livestock, when treated as a single risk factor, contributed signiﬁcantly to the burden of AMR in 
humans, although the presence of livestock waste was signiﬁcant. These results provide an understanding 
of the broader epidemiology of AMR in complex and interconnected urban environments.

1. Introduction 

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is regarded as one of 
the most serious public health threats of this century [1–3] . Over 
the last decade, increasing levels of resistance to clinically relevant 
antibiotics – including carbapenems [4] and colistin [5] , which are

considered antibiotics of last resort – have been reported in both 
human and animal populations. 

Although  Escherichia  coli  can  be  a  harmless  gut  commensal, 
some pathogenic strains can cause life-threatening bloodstream in- 
fections and common illnesses, such as urinary tract infections [6] . 
E.  coli  can

nomic losses due to mortality and morbidity [7] . Recently, E. coli 
was  categorized  by  the  World  Health  Organization  as  a  priority 
pathogen due to its widespread antibiotic resistance [8] . 

Livestock have been implicated as a reservoir for AMR bacteria 
that may spread to humans, with keeping livestock widely believed

the role of livestock in the emergence and 
transmission of AMR bacteria to human populations is lacking [11] , 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [12] . In 
the absence of routine surveillance of AMR in most LMICs, under- 
standing the epidemiology of AMR is key to developing effective 
strategies to target a reduction in the emergence and spread of re- 
sistance in the future. 

To  date,  studies  investigating  the  epidemiology  of  AMR  have 
tended to focus on
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
either human or livestock populations without 
making comparisons of resistance between the two populations. A 
recent systematic review [11] of studies investigating the link of 
AMR E. coli between humans and livestock found only 22 studies 
of spatiotemporally-related isolates from human and livestock pop- 
ulations, just six of which were conducted in LMICs. Notably, none 
of these studies considered urban livestock, which are of increasing 
importance, particularly in LMIC settings [13] ,

Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
and may contribute 
to the maintenance of zoonotic bacteria and AMR in the complex 
urban environment [14] . 

This study focused on the role of keeping livestock as a poten- 
tially high-risk urban interface for AMR transmission between hu- 
mans and livestock in urban Nairobi. Nairobi is a rapidly growing 
city  where  livestock  are  commonly  kept  within  household  com- 
pounds, bringing them into close contact with people. E. coli is an 
ideal organism to  study  the  spread of  AMR  in

this complex  en- 
vironment, as it is a ubiquitous commensal in both livestock and 
humans but with a wide range of resistance phenotypes. 

This  paper  reports  the  results  from  the  ﬁrst  study  to  char- 
acterize  the  patterns  and  epidemiology  of  antibiotic-resistant  E. 
coli  from  cohabiting  human  and  livestock  populations  in  a  low- 
resource urban setting. At the scale of individual households, the 
role of livestock is explored as a risk factor for AMR carriage in hu-

mans, hence providing insight into the pathways of AMR transfer. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Study design 

A  cross-sectional  study  targeting  sympatric  human  and  live- 
stock populations in Nairobi, Kenya was carried out from August 

2015 to October 2016 as part of the Urban Zoo Project [15] . Brieﬂy, 
Nairobi was stratiﬁed into administrative sublocations according to 
socio-economic status, identifying 70 possible sublocations. Thirty- 
three sublocations were chosen with the aim of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
maximizing spatial 
distribution and socio-economic diversity, and attempting to cap- 
ture the diversity of livestock-keeping practices across the city [15] . 
For each sublocation, three households – two that kept livestock 
[small livestock only (poultry, rabbits and goats) and large livestock 
(cattle and pigs) with or without small livestock] and one that did 
not keep livestock – were selected at random within the dominant 
housing type. 

In total, 99 households were involved in the
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
study ( Fig. 1 ). The 
design of the study is explained in detail in the online supplemen- 
tary material. 

2.2. Sample collection and antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

In each household, a questionnaire was used to collect data on 
household composition, socio-economic variables, livestock owner- 
ship, food consumption and medical history. Human and animal 
faecal samples were collected and transported on ice to one of two 
laboratories (University of Nairobi or Kenya Medical Research

tute) within 5 h of collection. Samples were enriched in buffered 
peptone water for 24 h, and thereafter plated on to eosin methy- 
lene blue agar (EMBA) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. One colony 
from each plate was selected and subcultured for a further 24 h on 
a second round of EMBA. Subsequently, one puriﬁed colony from 
each plate was selected at random (hereafter referred to as an ‘iso- 
late’), and conﬁrmed as E. coli by biochemical testing using triple 
sugar  iron  agar,

ity control of the susceptibility tests. 

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive criteria 
for  Enterobacteriaceae  [16]  were  used  to  determine  breakpoints 
for classifying isolates as either susceptible (‘susceptible’ or ‘inter- 
mediate’)  or  non-susceptible  (‘resistant’)  for  11  of  the  13  drugs. 
For tetracycline and trimethoprim, isolates were classiﬁed as re- 
sistant or susceptible because examination of the distributions of 
the zones of inhibition showed
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
populations of isolates with dis- 
tinct phenotypic resistance patterns (see Table S1 in online sup- 
plementary material). To describe multi-drug patterns, the overall 
resistance proﬁle was calculated by combining the resistance phe- 
notype to each individual class, and thus antibiogram length (here- 
after also referred to as ‘AMR carriage’) is the total number of an- 
tibiotic classes to which an isolate was phenotypically resistant. 

2.3. Statistical analysis 

The  distribution  of 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
resistance  phenotypes  between  hosts  was 
calculated  using  Chi-squared  tests  (humans  and  livestock)  and  a 
one-way  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA;  human  vs  different  live- 
stock  groups).  Tukey’s  multiple-comparison  test  was  performed 
post hoc for pairwise comparisons between groups, and P -values 
< 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. 

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), implemented in R 
package  ‘lme4’  [17] ,  with  antibiogram  length  as  the  dependent 
variable
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
were used to test whether AMR carriage differed between 
host groups. To investigate the co-occurrence of AMR phenotypes, 
a  pairwise  co-occurrence  matrix  (presence  and  absence)  of  the 
phenotypes was constructed using polycor package [18] in R and 
the co-occurrence relationships were visualized using corrplot [19] . 
A correlation between two AMR phenotypes was considered statis- 
tically signiﬁcant if the P -value (adjusted for multiple testing using 
Bonferroni’s correction) was <
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
0.05. 

To investigate ﬁner scale household-level risk factors for AMR 
carriage in humans, a Poisson-distributed GLMM was ﬁtted with 
the counts of resistance phenotypes (antibiogram length) as the re- 
sponse variable. Model explanatory variables were human density 
(count of people in a household as a function of household area) 
and types of livestock kept by the household (small livestock only, 
large livestock with or without small livestock, and no livestock). 
Additionally, for
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
households that kept livestock, a separate Poisson- 
distributed  GLMM  was  ﬁtted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  human 
density  and  manure  disposal  practises  (manure  disposed  in  the 
household  compound  or  outside)  on  human  antibiogram  length. 
Separate models were ﬁtted for the most prevalent AMR pheno- 
types (tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, penicillins and 
trimethoprim). 

To account for the nested (or hierarchical) nature of the sam- 
pling  design, 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
household  site  ( n = 99),  sublocation  ( n = 33)  and 
wealth category ( n = 7) were included as random factors. Further 
details of data exploration and statistical models are given in the 
online supplementary material. 

3. Results 

In total, 954 isolates composed of 321 human and 633 livestock 
E. coli isolates were analysed. The number of isolates obtained from

of  livestock  ( P < 0.05,  one-way  ANOVA  with  Tukey’s  multiple-

( χ 2 = 17.6,  P < 0.01,  Chi-squared  test).  Of  the  217  pan-susceptible

156 (45.2%) poultry, 24 (47.1%) pigs, nine (22.0%) rabbits, 14 (21.9%)

multi-resistance, this cluster was commonly associated with resis- 
tance to aminoglycoside and penicillins. 

3.2. AMR exchange between humans and livestock at the household 
level 

In  any  given  household,  no  evidence  was  found  to  indicate 
that the presence of livestock increased the risk of human AMR 
carriage  (large  livestock  OR = 0.94,  95%  CI  0.72–1.22,  P = 0.24;

R 2 = 0.3, GLMM) ( Table 4 ). However, human antibiogram length in- 
creased with human density (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.47, P = 0.003, 
marginal R 2 = 0.3, GLMM) ( Fig. 5 ). The impact of keeping livestock 
on  human  AMR  carriage  was  potentially  inﬂuenced  by  disposal 
practices  of  animal  manure:  keeping  manure  inside  the  house- 
hold perimeter, compared with disposing of it externally, was as- 
sociated

with  greater  human  antibiogram  length  (OR = 1.29,  95% 
CI  1.02–1.63, P = 0.03,  marginal R 2 = 0.5,  GLMM)  ( Table  4 ).  These 
results  were  consistent  when  separate  analyses  were  performed 
for the individual resistances (Table S3, see online supplementary 
material).

tance to seven or more antibiotic classes tested; ﬁve (1.6%) from 
humans and three (0.9%) from poultry ( Fig. 3 ). 

Antibiogram length (i.e. the total number of antibiotic classes 
to which an isolate is resistant) was signiﬁcantly higher in humans 
than  in  livestock  [odds  ratio  (OR) = 1.14,  95%  conﬁdence  interval 
(CI) 0.68–0.81, P < 0.01, marginal R 2 = 0.041, GLMM]. However, when
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
studied in more detail, antibiogram lengths in human isolates were 
similar to those from pigs and poultry ( P > 0.05, marginal R 2 = 0.151, 
GLMM) but signiﬁcantly higher than those from bovines, goats and 
rabbits ( P < 0.05, marginal R 2 = 0.151, GLMM) ( Table 3 and Fig. 3 ). 

Examination  of  the  similarity  of  E.  coli  antibiograms  from

4. Discussion 

This study applied ecological and epidemiological approaches to 
characterize the epidemiology of AMR E. coli isolates collected
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
sys- 
tematically from sympatric human and livestock populations in the 
rapidly developing urban landscape of Nairobi, Kenya. 

Resistance  to  aminoglycosides,  sulfonamides,  tetracyclines, 
trimethoprim and penicillins was high in both humans and live- 
stock, while resistance to cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones was 
low. These results are consistent with previous studies [20–23] and 
may reﬂect, in part, the patterns of antibiotic use in human and 
animal health. However, background data
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
on antimicrobial use in 
these populations is limited. The results indicating a high preva- 
lence of AMR carriage are based on non-clinical isolates from hu- 
mans and livestock. 

When  analysed  by  host,  human  isolates  appeared  to  have 
a  higher  prevalence  of  AMR  carriage  compared  with  livestock 
isolates,  with  the  exception  of  tetracyclines.  In  particular,  the 
observed  prevalence  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  in  four  clinically 

relevant  antibiotic  classes: 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
penicillins,  sulphonamides,  trimetho- 
prim and aminoglycosides. A possible explanation for this variation 
in AMR carriage is that it relates to variation in antibiotic use be- 
tween these populations. Although antibiotics are used extensively 
in  both  human  and  livestock  populations,  previous  studies  have 
shown  that  frequency  of  use  of  antibiotics  is  higher  in  human 
medicine  than  in  livestock  medicine,  especially  in  resource-poor 
settings  [24 , 25] . 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
Similarly,  in  community  settings  where  over- 
the-counter access to drugs is common, it is likely that humans 
have  access  to  a  broader  range  of  antibiotics,  either  through 
self-medication or inappropriate prescribing; common practices in 
many LMICs [26 , 27] . Likewise, in such settings, infections are com- 
monly  treated  empirically  (often  using  antibiotics)  with  limited 
microbiological investigations to ascertain the causal organism(s). 

Although the use of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
chloramphenicol in food animals has been 
banned in Kenya [28] , 3% resistance to this antibiotic in livestock 
was  noted.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  use  of  ﬂorfenicol,  a 
ﬂuorinated  derivative  of  chloramphenicol,  which  shows  some 
cross-resistance with chloramphenicol [29] . Similarly, the observed

levels of resistance against ciproﬂoxacin (a quinolone

antimicrobial 
not licensed for veterinary use) among livestock isolates is prob- 
ably explained by cross-resistance with other quinolones used in 
veterinary medicine, such as enroﬂoxacin and norﬂoxacin. 

At the household level, there is evidence of an intricate inter- 
play between humans and livestock in relation to the development 
and transmission of AMR. This analysis revealed that human AMR 
carriage increased with number of occupants in a household, and 
that  keeping  manure  inside 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
the  household  compound  was  also 
signiﬁcantly  associated  with  AMR  carriage  in  humans.  In  urban 
Nairobi, people live in a continuum of urban spaces with varying 
human and animal population densities, with the majority ( > 60%) 
of people living in slums [30 , 31] ; environments characterized by 
small  household  areas  and  high  population  densities.  Population 
density is an important factor in the population prevalence of AMR 
[32] ,  and  may,  in  part,  be  due  to  the 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
signiﬁcant  correlation  be- 
tween overcrowding and high burden of infectious diseases more 
broadly [33] ; an important driver of antibiotic use in resource-poor 
settings such as Nairobi. Similarly, high human populations within 
a  household  result  in  greater  epidemiological  connectivity,  thus 
facilitating exchange of AMR bacteria and their AMR determinants. 
The  number  of  urban  dwellers  in  the  majority  of  LMIC  cities, 
including  Nairobi,  is  projected  to  grow 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
signiﬁcantly  in  the  near 
future  [34] .  While  this  urban  demographic  change  is  unfolding, 
disease  burden  is  expected  to  burgeon,  precipitating  high  use 
of  antibiotics.  For  this  reason,  measures  to  curb  the  infectious 
diseases burden by public health policy makers, in part to reduce 
drug pressure on micro-organisms, are needed. 

These results suggest that, at the household level, keeping live- 
stock  in  and  of  itself  does  not  add  to  the  risk  of 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
acquisition  or 
carriage of AMR bacteria in humans. However, given the multiple 
pathways  of  AMR  exchange  between  humans  and  livestock  [35] , 
via the food chain or due to environmental pollution, it is possi- 
ble that the direct effect of keeping livestock on levels of AMR in 
humans could be confounded by other factors not captured in this 
study. This study does, however, suggest that, whilst AMR carriage 
(antibiogram length) was not directly associated with the presence 
of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
livestock in the household, the impact of keeping livestock on 
human AMR carriage was mediated by some practices associated 
with  keeping  livestock,  namely  the  presence  or  absence  of  ani- 
mal manure in the household. These results support other studies 
that have identiﬁed animal manure as a reservoir of AMR bacte- 
ria and AMR determinants [36 , 37] . Importantly, ampliﬁcation and 
persistence of AMR determinants such as AMR plasmids can take 
place in manure and be further
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
disseminated to humans via cross- 
contamination pathways such as through exposed water and food 
[38] , or via peri-domestic wildlife. Although there is still a lack of 
knowledge concerning the exact mechanism, particularly the ge- 
netic  basis  of  transmission  [39] ,  strategies  that  limit  AMR  gene 
ﬂow  to  and  from  manure  (to  humans)  should  be  adopted.  Such 
measures  include  safe  disposal  of  manure  from  households,  and 
manure pre-treatment prior to application on to
----

crop farms where 
possible. 

It  is  important  to  note  that,  while  this  analysis  was  not  de- 
signed to address transmission of AMR bacteria and their AMR de- 
terminants,  it  is  also  plausible  that  clonal  expansion  could  have 
played a role in the observed AMR patterns. The ﬁnding of 35 com- 
mon AMR proﬁles in both human and livestock bacterial popula- 
tions may, in part, reﬂect overlapping antibiotic usage patterns, ac- 
quisition of AMR from a shared source or clonal
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
expansion. It is 
hypothesized that the ﬁnding that 30.5% (340/954) of all isolates 
contain a tetracycline-sulfonamide-trimethoprim cluster phenotype 
and that the pairwise correlations between these three antibiotic 
classes were very high is suggestive of a conjugative MDR plasmid 
circulating within the E. coli population in both human and live- 
stock populations. AMR genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, 

sulfonamide and trimethoprim antibiotic classes are commonly as- 
sociated 
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
with  mobile  genetic  elements  [40] ,  and  these  elements 
play a pivotal role in dissemination of multi-drug resistance in E. 
coli isolates. Genetic data are required to validate the existence of 
mobile genetic elements, and determine whether AMR genes are 
being transferred across them. 

Distinguishing  molecular  transmission  of  AMR  from  selection 
for  AMR  due  to  antibiotic  use  is  challenging  [11] .  In  particular, 
in an urban environment such as Nairobi, where human
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
habita- 
tion, keeping livestock and food supply chains are interconnected 
[41] , the relative contributions of the aforementioned drivers are 
diﬃcult  to  quantify.  At  a  ﬁner  scale,  any  study  investigating 
the transmission of AMR between humans and livestock in low- 
resource  settings  needs  to  consider  indirect  transmission,  rather 
than just direct animal-to-human and/or human-to-animal trans- 
mission. Whilst direct host-to-host transmission of AMR bacteria 
and AMR
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
determinants may occur, in these intricate ecosystems, 
the role played by the wider environment (e.g. wildlife, soil and, 
in particular, hospital and farm eﬄuents) in relation to acquisition 
of AMR from a common source may be vital. 

5. Conclusion 

This rigorously structured epidemiological study found a high 
prevalence of AMR E. coli carriage in livestock and humans outside 
the clinical setting across a developing country urban landscape, 
with no evidence that direct contact with
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
livestock contributes to 
the burden of human AMR, but that indirect contact between live- 
stock and humans does play a role. In LMIC urban ecosystems, the 
elevated prevalence of AMR in both human and livestock popula- 
tions could be attributed to unregulated access to antibiotics, poor 
hygiene and sanitation, and waste management, which encourage 
the evolution and spread of AMR bacteria. These ﬁndings highlight 
a need for targeted surveillance strategies across various sectors, 
and  for
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S0924857919302250-main.pdf
actors  to  address  and  design  effective  measures  to  curb 
AMR in these populations, both in Nairobi and in other similar ur- 
ban landscapes. Further work is required to understand the ecol- 
ogy of genetic determinants of resistance, particularly the extent 
of the role that plasmids play in the dissemination and evolution 
of resistance traits in these human and livestock populations.

to

humans and animals, leading to colonization and infection. Considering these characteristics, ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’ are
potential vectors for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This review deﬁnes the role of ﬂies in the
spread of AMR and identiﬁes knowledge gaps.
Methods: The literature search (original articles, reviews indexed for PubMed) was restricted to the English
language. References of identiﬁed studies were screened for additional sources.
Results: ‘Filth ﬂies’ are colonized with

Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of clinical relevance. This includes ex-
tended spectrum beta-lactamase-, carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) bacteria.
Resistant bacteria in ﬂies often share the same genotypes with bacteria from humans and animals when their
habitat overlap. The risk of transmission is most likely highest for enteric bacteria as they are shed in high
concentration in excrements and are easily picked up by ﬂies. ‘Filth ﬂies’ can ‘bio-enhance’ the

transmission of
AMR as bacteria multiply in the digestive tract, mouthparts and regurgitation spots.
Conclusion: To better understand the medical importance of AMR in ﬂies, quantitative risk assessment models
should be reﬁned and fed with additional data (e.g. vectorial capacity, colonization dose). This requires targeted
ecological, epidemiological and in vivo experimental studies.

1. Introduction

“According to our best sanitarians”, Samuel Miller reported to the
Massachusetts Association of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
Boards of Health in 1914 “ﬂies breed
disease” and concluded: “The ﬂy is a curse.” [1]. So-called ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’
have been linked to faecal-oral transmission of bacteria [2], fungi [3,4],
parasites [5,6] and viruses [7,8] (Fig. 1). ‘Filth ﬂies’ are deﬁned as ﬂies
that use excrement and decaying matter for nutrition and oviposition
[9]. All medically relevant ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’ have some characteristics in
common: they are coprophagic (feeding on animal manure and human
faeces) or omnivorous, synanthropic
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
(living in association with hu-
mans) and endophilic (preferring in-house dwelling) [10]. Of over
125,000 species belonging to the order Diptera (true ﬂies) at least two
‘ﬁlth ﬂies’ are involved in the transmission of
main families of

medically important pathogens namely Muscidae, and Calliphoridae
[5,11]. Moreover, these ﬂies have a great potential to contribute to the
dissemination of bacteria (e.g. enteric pathogens and commensal bac-
teria) due to their remarkable ability to move freely

Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
between diﬀerent
habitats and overcome long ﬂight distances (5–7 km) [12–16]. There-
fore, it is likely that they play a role in the spread of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) between animals and humans. Recent reports have
shown that the ﬂy gut provides a suitable environment for carriage of
antimicrobial resistant bacteria and horizontal transfer of AMR genes
[17,18].

Mathematical models are suitable tools to assess the risk bacterial
transmission. The quantitative microbial risk assessment

health outcomes), exposure (i.e. pathways of microbes to reach the
population) and risk characterization (i.e. probability of an health
outcome after exposure) [19]. Such a QMRA has been developed for the
transmission of resistant bacteria from poultry to humans through ﬂies
[20].

In their review, Zurek and Gosh already described the colonization
of insects in general with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and suggested
that ﬂies
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
play a role in the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria
between livestock and urban areas [21]. In our review we built on this
work by giving an updated epidemiological picture of AMR with a
special focus on ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’ and on emerging antimicrobial resistance
phenotypes of clinical relevance (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lacta-
mase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem- and colistin
resistant Gram-negative bacteria, see Supplement and Table A1 for
methods). We identiﬁed

knowledge gaps and suggest topics for future
research initiatives.

2. Occurrence and fate of medically relevant bacteria in ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’

Flies can carry medically relevant bacteria on the surface of their
exoskeleton (e.g. legs, mouthparts) and in the alimentary canal (Table
through
A2). Consequently, bacterial

transmission can occur

regurgitation, defecation or translocation from the exoskeleton (Figs. 1
and 2) [2]. The ingestion of ﬂies by insectivores could be an additional
route of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
transmission [22]. Finally, degrading ﬂies can contaminate the
environment with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Numerous studies
assessed bacterial colonization in pooled ﬂy samples [12,23–25].
However, this approach is inappropriate to measure the actual pre-
valence in individual ﬂies.

It is methodically simple to analyze the prevalence of bacteria on
the body surface (washing oﬀ the microbiota from the exoskeleton)
separately from the intestine (dissection of the alimentary canal
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
after
surface disinfection) [26]. The available studies applied diﬀerent pa-
thogen detection methods (e.g. PCR, culture, selective media, and broth
enrichment). Therefore, the carrier rates should be compared cau-
tiously.

According to a study analyzing individual ﬂies

(Muscidae,
Calliphoridae) collected from urban restaurants in the USA, similar co-
lonization rates were found in the intestine compared to the exoske-
leton for Salmonella enterica (6 vs. 1%) and Listeria monocytogenes (3
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
vs.
1%) using a PCR-based system [27]. However, the majority of studies
analyzed bacterial colonization of the body surface only. Very high
rates were found for Klebsiella spp. (51.9%), Escherichia coli (32.1%) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.9%) in ﬂies collected from fresh-food
markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and rice paddies in

animals through ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’. Flies can transmit antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through regurgitation, translocation from the
exoskeleton and defeacation. Flies ingest ﬂuids that can be contaminated with bacteria. These bacteria multiply in the crop (a diverticulum of the digestive tract in higher ﬂies, in blue)
and are subsequently transferred to the gut or are regurgitated leading to the concept of “bioenhance transmission” [37]. Since ﬂies share their habitat with both animals and

Thailand using non-selective solid culture media [28] (Table A2). Co-
lonization rates of ﬂies vary for enteric pathogens such as Salmonella
(26.4%, Taiwanese swine farms, culture-based detection), Campylo-
bacter (up to 25.5%, US broiler farm, PCR detection) or Shigella spp.
(9.6%, rural

Thailand, culture based detection) [23,28,29]. The mi-
crobiome of Diptera is dynamic and diverse; its composition depends on
the species, life stage, sex and season [30,31].

Adult ﬂies ingest bacteria through contaminated ﬂuids. Bacteria are
ﬁrst stored in the ﬂy's crop where they can multiply (Fig. 2) [32]. From
here, bacteria are either regurgitated or transferred to the alimentary

canal (proventriculus, midgut, hindgut, and rectum). The midgut epi-
thelium is lined with a peritrophic
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
matrix, which protects the ﬂy from
microbes, but allows enzymes and antimicrobial peptides to enter the
lumen [33]. Therefore, the alimentary canal of ﬂies seems to be a
hostile environment for the majority of bacterial species, resulting in an
exponential decline (Fig. 3) [32–37]. The ability to slow down this
decrease or even proliferate in the ﬂy's gut (as shown for Aeromonas
caviae and Salmonella typhimurium) seems to depend on the mobility of
bacteria, the temperature, and the bacterial

mouthparts (e.g. labellum, proboscis) was less studied. Two studies
suggest
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
a rapid decline in bacterial concentration (Campylobacter jejuni,
Enterococcus faecalis) on mouthparts from 100% of the feeding con-
centration to < 1% within 2 h [32,38]. Other studies also report this
initial decline but showed signiﬁcantly increased bacterial counts 2–6
days after feeding a deﬁned concentration of E. faecalis (3.1 × 106) [32]
or E. coli (diﬀerent feeding sources were used, e.g. cow manure with
107 cells/ml) [40]. This increase is most likely explained by
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
bacterial
proliferation in the crop and subsequent regurgitation, so that bacteria
could be recovered from mouthparts (Fig. 2) [32]. The amount and
frequency of regurgitation is inﬂuenced by a variety of factors, in-
cluding species [41], ﬂy density and host presence [42], temperature
and relative humidity [43], or reproductive status [44].

Flies primarily transmit bacteria through mouthparts and regur-
gitation and less likely through defeacation. In addition, bacteria con-
tinue multiplying
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
in mouthparts and regurgitation spots as shown for E.
coli O157:H7 [37,40]. Taken together, the ﬂy is not only a mechanical
vector that transmits bacteria by translocation from the exoskeleton.
“Bio-enhanced transmission”, a term initially coined by Kobayashi et al.
for E. coli O157:H7 [37], best describes the fate of bacteria in ﬂies.

Bacterial contamination of the larval substrate appears to play a role
where female ﬂies choose to lay their eggs [45]. Bacteria are essential
to the
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
development of house ﬂies [46,47], and stable ﬂies [48,49] (both
Muscidae). Bacteria remaining in the larval alimentary tract at the time
of pupation can proliferate during metamorphosis but are mostly
evacuated in the puparium during adult emergence [50,51]. Newly
emerged adult ﬂies tend to harbour a surprisingly low amount of bac-
teria, but puparia contain large amounts and can serve as reservoirs to
maintain local contamination (e.g. of a farm) [51].

Nevertheless, how eﬀectively do ﬂies
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
transmit bacteria? This ques-
tion refers to ‘vector competence’ (i.e. ability to transmit an infectious
agent), a term that is commonly used in mosquitoes. There is good
evidence that ﬂies can eﬀectively contaminate food products, animals
and the environment. After ingesting a deﬁned concentration of bac-
teria, ﬂies were exposed to several items from where the bacteria were
recovered later on. This has been shown for E. coli O157:H7 on spinach
leaves and calves [40,52,53], E. faecalis on
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
hamburger beef patties [54],
Aeromonas caviae on chicken meat [55] or C. jejuni from chickens [56].
There is only one historic study conducted by Greenberg [57], which
assessed the vector competence of house ﬂies to transmit S. typhi-
murium to humans. After ﬂies were fed with S. typhimurium and
subsequently allowed to contaminate food, S. typhimurium was iso-
lated in due course from faeces of 6/10 volunteers, who had eaten the
contaminated food. However, none of the volunteers developed
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
symp-
toms of disease, presumably due to the low inoculum in the house ﬂy
feed.

The sole presence of bacteria on food items does not imply trans-
mission or predict subsequent infection in humans or animals. To assess
the vector potential of ﬂies more accurately, the transmission of “colony
forming units” (CFU) has been quantiﬁed under controlled experi-
mental set-ups. Depending on the number of ﬂies, 3.1 × 103 (5 M.
domestica) – 2.8 × 104 (40 M. domestica) CFUs of E. faecalis
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
were
transmitted within 30 min to 1 g of beef patty [54]. In this study, ﬂies
were ﬁeld collected and were not exposed to a deﬁned bacterial con-
centration [54]. Similarly, 102.6–103.5 CFU of E. coli per ﬂy landing
were transmitted by M. domestica to a sterile surface after exposing the
ﬂies to 108 CFU/g of either sugar-milk, steak or potato salad for 30 min
[58]. A ﬁeld study from Bangladesh revealed that an average of >
0.6 × 103 CFU of E. coli were transmitted to rice per ﬂy landing
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
[59].
Clostridium diﬃcile spores were less eﬀectively transmitted by M. do-
mestica to cycloserine cefoxitin fructose agar (sodium taurocholate
supplement): after exposure to 105 C. diﬃcile spores for 6 min, 288 CFU
were transmitted 1 h later [60].

In conclusion, ﬂies can transmit bacteria to food products, animals
and the environment, most likely through mouthparts and regurgita-
tion. It appears plausible that this is also true for antimicrobial-resistant

bacteria.

3. Antimicrobial
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
resistance in ﬂies

Numerous studies have shown that ﬂies can carry antimicrobial
resistant bacteria (Table 1). Among the AMR phenotypes of clinical
interest, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing public
health concern due to their spread in humans and animals [61]. ESBLs
are plasmid-borne beta-lactamases conferring resistance to ﬁrst, second
and third generation cephalosporins and monobactams [61]. ESBL-
producing Enterobacteriaceae have been reported on ﬂies in Asia, Africa
and
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
Europe with colonization rates of up to 17% (Table 1) [62].

The occurrence of carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneu-
moniae (e.g. NDM, VIM carbapenemases) in ﬂies captured from live-
stock and farms in China, Germany, and Iran is most worrisome as
treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Gram-ne-
gative bacteria are limited (Table 1) [22,63,64]. Genes encoding for
carbapenemases can be transmitted between bacteria through mobile
genetic elements and ﬂies can be a
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
suitable environment for the ex-
change of resistance genes between diﬀerent bacterial species [65].

Colistin is often the drug of choice for the treatment of infections
caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in human medicine.
However, colistin was used as a growth promotor in poultry production
[22] and is nowadays widely used for management of gastroenteritis in
pigs and cattle [66]. Chromosomal mutations leading to colistin re-
sistance genes are known for a long time. In 2015,
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
a study from China
reported for the ﬁrst time the occurrence of a gene (mcr-1) mediating
colistin resistance, which is located on a transferable plasmid [67].
Colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) E. coli have now been detected in ﬂies
from pig and poultry farms in China and Germany (Table 1) [22,68].
The colonization rates of ﬂies with antimicrobial-resistant Gram-
positive bacteria of clinical importance such as vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) are low (0–1.3%), based on few studies from Africa and
Europe (Table 1) [69–71].

In conclusion, the prevalence of AMR in ﬂies is higher in Gram-
negative (e.g. E. coli and K. pneumoniae) than in Gram-positive bacteria
(e.g. S. aureus and E. faecium, Table 1). The risk of AMR transmission
might therefore be highest for Enterobacteriaceae.

4. Transmission of bacteria and mobile genetic elements

Under optimal living conditions, ﬂies do not tend to roam far.
However,
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
they can have a ﬂight range of 5–7 km and therefore disperse
bacteria between diﬀerent regions [15,16]. This is of importance when
assessing the spread of AMR through ﬂies.

Many of the studies examining antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in
ﬂies have focused on the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and the
associated types of phenotypic resistance or resistance genes. By in-
ference, it can be predicted that ﬂies act as vectors of AMR but studies
examining either the direct spread of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by
ﬂies or the transfer of resistance genes in ﬂies are relatively uncommon.
In some cases, bacterial typing techniques such as pulsed ﬁeld gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) or multilocus sequence typing (MLST) have
been used to examine the distribution of bacterial genotypes in ﬂies,
humans, and livestock in diﬀerent settings to provide evidence for
transmission of bacteria. Such studies have been carried out in a variety
of environments including chicken, pig and
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
cattle farms, as well as
hospitals and restaurants in urban areas providing information on
which environmental settings support the spread of AMR by ﬂies
[2,29,69,71–79]. In one study, ESBL-producing E. coli was detected on
ﬂies on land areas surrounding broiler chicken farms [75]. Typing
analysis of the isolates, resistance genes and plasmids demonstrated
persistence of the same clones in the farm environment over several
months suggesting that ﬂies can carry antimicrobial-resistant

bacteria
within deﬁned areas for long periods of time [75]. However, evidence

for the direction of transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria was
not

provided. Most likely, bacteria are transmitted from resident ani-
mals to ﬂies since ﬂies feed on animal faeces and antibiotic selective
pressure is directly exerted on the faecal microbiota of treated animals.
However, ﬂies can potentially enhance dissemination of antimicrobial-
resistant bacteria to other farms or human households in the vicinity, as
well as through diﬀerent production cycles within the same farm.

When von Salviati et al. examined the spread of ESBL/AmpC-pro-
ducing
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
bacteria in pig farms, PFGE analysis suggested that ﬂies were
vectors of these bacteria as identical PFGE types were identiﬁed in
samples from ﬂies, and pooled faeces from pigs [78]. This is consistent
with a study from China where ﬂies and farmers shared the same
(mcr-1) and carbapenem-resistant
genotypes of colistin-resistant
(blaNDM) E. coli [22]. In addition, Ahmad et al. identiﬁed Enterococcus
spp. containing the resistance genes tetM and ermB among samples from
house ﬂies, cockroaches and
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
pig faeces on commercial swine farms
[72]. The indistinguishable PFGE types suggested that ﬂies were in-
volved in transmitting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between pigs
and the environment [72]. In another study, Wang et al. isolated S.
enterica resistant to multiple antibiotics that had identical PFGE types in
ﬂies and swine faeces suggesting ﬂies could act as vectors for trans-
mission [29]. A study on a cattle farm in Japan revealed that ﬂies
carried several diﬀerent clones of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
ESBL-producing E. coli that were also
found in cattle faeces, and suggested that plasmids harboring the blaCTX-
M-15 gene were potentially transferable [76]. Finally, hospitals in Africa
can be infested with house ﬂies carrying antimicrobial-resistant Pseu-
domonas spp., enterococci and staphylococci. In some cases, these
bacteria display the same susceptibility proﬁles that were observed in
clinical isolates from patients in the same hospital [71,73]. A relatively
small number of studies have
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
investigated the capacity of ﬂies to act as
biological vectors for the spread of AMR genes among bacteria occu-
pying the ﬂy gut niche. Although there is strong evidence for the me-
chanical transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by ﬂies, there is a
lack of substantial evidence supporting transfer of AMR genes in the
midgut of ﬂies. Wei et al. demonstrated that Proteus mirabilis (blaTEM-,
and aphA1-positive) could persist in the digestive tract of ﬂies for sev-
eral days and compete
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
favorably with antimicrobial-susceptible isolates
[80]. This suggests two important points: the conditions in ﬂies could
theoretically support the potential horizontal transfer of AMR genes
and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can persistently (not only tran-
siently) colonize ﬂies. For instance, blaCTX-M can be transferred on
conjugative plasmids from E. coli to other bacteria (e.g. Achromobacter
and Pseudomonas) in the intestine of house ﬂies providing direct evi-
dence for the emergence of
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through
horizontal transfer in the ﬂy gut [17]. Similarly, the tetM gene on
conjugative plasmid pCF10 can be transferred among E. faecalis strains
[18] and Petridis et al. reported a transfer of plasmid-encoded chlor-
amphenicol resistance genes and bacteriophage-encoded Shiga-toxin
gene stx1 in the midgut of house ﬂies [81]. This horizontal gene transfer
might not only happen under laboratory conditions but also occur in
real-life settings. For instance, E.
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
coli was collected from humans, ﬂies,
horses and surfaces in an equine clinic. Although the majority of the
isolates belonged to diﬀerent PFGE types, they shared identical plas-
mids, highlighting the relevance of horizontal gene transfer [82].

Of note, ‘ﬁlth ﬂy’ larvae can also be involved in reducing the spread
of AMR: the larvae can attenuate antimicrobial agents and reduce AMR
genes during vermicomposting of manure [83,84].

Overall, these studies stress the potential of ﬂies to act as
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
vectors for
the spread of resistant bacteria and for the transfer of AMR genes across
bacterial species and hosts.

5. Sampling methods

Surveillance of AMR in ﬂies necessitates regular ﬁeld studies to
assess the geographical spread and colonization rates of the anti-
microbial-resistant pathogens of interest. The microbiological analysis

13

F.C. Onwugamba et al.

Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease 22 (2018) 8–17

of individual ﬂies should always be preferred over analyses of pooled
ﬂies
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
as the latter necessarily overestimates the burden of AMR in ﬂies
[69]. GPS data of sampling points would be beneﬁcial when reporting
AMR colonization rates in ﬂies. This will help to identify geographical
patterns and key regions for potential interventions.

Numerous sampling methods are available and the selection de-
pends on the objective of the study (Table 2). Major challenges are to
avoid artiﬁcial contamination of the exoskeleton during sampling. One
workaround is to sanitize
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
individual ﬂies in 70% ethanol or 0.26%
sodium hypochlorite, which will disinfect the surface and not the in-
testinal microbiota [26,46,85].

6. Medical relevance of antimicrobial resistance in ﬂies

‘Filth ﬂies’ have since long been considered as playing a role in the
spread and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens, providing one
possible link in the interface between faeces, or contaminated soil, and
food (Fig. 1) [40,52]. Numerous studies reported colonization of house
ﬂies with

enteropathogenic bacteria. Whilst it is plausible, there is only
limited evidence that house ﬂies transmit these bacteria, causing not
only colonization but also disease in humans and animals.

Seasonal peaks of house ﬂy infestation and cases of shigellosis have
been described to coincide [86]. Indirect evidence (given that con-
founding and some methodical limitations cannot be ruled out) for a
role of M. domestica as vector of Shigella spp., leading to a surge in
shigellosis stems from a
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
study in Bangladesh [13]. Modelling suggests
that about 40% of cases might have been prevented by improved
household ﬂy infestation control. There is good evidence that control of
ﬂies is protective against shigellosis and campylobacteriosis in animals
and humans [87–89].

Deﬁnite proof of bacterial transmission from contaminants via ﬂies
to people leading to documented disease and tying disease to a con-
tamination chain is scarce mainly due to methodological and ethical
challenges. Current
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
evidence suggests that bacteria are transmitted
from ﬂies to humans and animals in suﬃcient doses to cause disease.
Therefore, it is likely that this is also true for antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria. However, the evidence for this assumption is weak and no
transmission studies between ﬂies and humans/animals have been
performed under controlled conditions. Nevertheless, several studies
from North Africa [71], sub-Saharan Africa [73], and India [14] de-
monstrated carriage, vector and

The Mediterranean moth ﬂy Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera:
Psychodinae), generally not considered as ‘ﬁlth ﬂies’ in the strict sense,
has spread towards Northern Europe and can be a pest in healthcare
facilities. In a study amongst four infested German hospitals

[90],
medically relevant bacteria (e.g. Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, K.
pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa) were isolated from the intestinal tract
and exoskeleton of C. albipunctata; however, no link was established
between carriage/infestation and human infection. Some studies re-
vealed that antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from ﬂies, animals and
humans shared the same genetic background [14,22,29,69,72,78],
suggesting transmission. Since the design of these studies was cross-
sectional, the
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
direction of transmission remains speculative and only
possible transmission routes can be highlighted [22]. The only evidence
to date is that isolates from ﬂies, animals and humans have a common
source, which most likely includes transmission events that could be
facilitated by ﬂies. Mathematical modelling suggests, that the exposure
is higher through ﬂies than
of humans to ESBL-producing E. coli
through chicken ﬁllet [20]. This QMRA, that used a worst-case ap-
proach, is valuable to assess
----
Source: 1-s2.0-S1477893918300371-main.pdf
the public health relevance of ﬂies and the
spread of AMR. However, results should be taken with caution, as
several parameters were not included in this model (e.g. “colonization
dose”, lifespan of the vector, time between donor (poultry) and re-
cipient (human), Table 3). Looking at the current evidence, we identi-
ﬁed several knowledge gaps to ﬁnally answer the question to what
extent ﬂies contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

Laboratory studies suggest a ”bio-enhanced” transmission since bac-
teria can multiply in the intestine, mouthparts and regurgitation spots.
Several factors inﬂuence this transmission route (e.g. climate, ﬂy den-
sity, geography, sanitary systems, food chain, vicinity of livestock farms
and households). However, limited, data are available to determine
whether ﬂies can transmit

Abstract
The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance is one of the major global issues currently threatening the health and wealth
of nations, with effective guidelines and intervention strategies

urgently required. Such guidelines and interventions should
ideally be targeted at individuals, communities, and nations, requiring international coordination for maximum effect. In this
respect, the European Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance Transnational Working Group ‘Antimicrobial
Resistance - Rapid Diagnostic Tests’ (JPIAMR AMR-RDT) is proposing to consider a ‘mix-and-match’ package for the imple-
mentation of point-of-care testing (PoCT), which is described in this

publication. The working group was established with the
remit of identifying barriers and solutions to the development and implementation of rapid infectious disease PoCT for combatting
the global spread of antimicrobial resistance. It constitutes a multi-sectoral collaboration between medical, technological, and
industrial opinion leaders involved in in vitro diagnostics development, medical microbiology, and clinical infectious diseases.
The mix-and-match implementation package is designed to

encourage the implementation of rapid infectious disease and antimi-
crobial resistance PoCT in transnational medical environments for use in the fight against increasing antimicrobial resistance.

Introduction

Infectious diseases are one of the major contributors to
global morbidity and mortality. Further, the worldwide
spread of antimicrobial resistance means that this burden
is steadily increasing on a global scale, with the possibility
of untreatable infectious diseases being commonplace in
the near future [1]. Therefore, internationally coordinated
efforts are required to find, describe, and
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
implement effec-
tive global healthcare strategies that will help combat the
threat of untreatable infectious diseases. In this respect,
the use of rapid infectious disease and antimicrobial resis-
tance point-of-care testing (PoCT) can be a key tool in
tackling the global burden of infectious disease and limit
the emergence and global spread of antimicrobial resistant
microorganisms. Further, in this publication, the authors
suggest that a ‘mix-and-match’ implementation package
is required in
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
order to ensure the most effective and effi-
cient uptake and sustainability of rapid infectious disease
and antimicrobial resistance PoCT. The term ‘implemen-
tation’ as used in this publication relates to a number of
issues, including positively influencing clinical decision-
making processes, helping inform patients on how to
change their current behaviour, and taking note of
healthcare economics, whereby healthcare providers ex-
pect ‘value for money’ with respect to the detection
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
and
treatment of infectious disease. A PoCT ‘mix-and-match
implementation package’ is defined as an implementation
package that offers a mixture of recommendations that can
be individually chosen to best match the needs of
healthcare providers, technology innovators, and the gen-
eral public, whilst helping to ensure the sustainability
(future-proofing) of rapid infectious disease and antimi-
crobial resistance PoCT.

Mix-and-match implementation package
for healthcare providers

Healthcare
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
providers (including institutions such as hospitals,
clinics, and emergency rooms, as well as individual clinical
professionals such as doctors and nurses) are the primary po-
tential users of rapid infectious disease and antimicrobial re-
sistance PoCT, having direct access to patients and making
empirical decisions about the actual need for a particular di-
agnostic test.

Healthcare providers should be encouraged to establish
their own PoCT ‘working groups’, with the responsibility
for
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
establishing a policy for the implementation of rapid in-
fectious disease and antimicrobial resistance PoCT into their
own particular healthcare setting [2]. These working groups
would also provide a focal point for the generation and distri-
bution of point-of-care educational material to medical

Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2019) 38:1015–1022

personnel. This will help to generate and maintain quality
standards, for example, compliance with ISO 22870 accredi-
tation. The working group
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
should consider making a five
point pre-implementation plan: (1) surveying information on
perceived and real advantages and disadvantages of point-of-
care testing within their own institution; (2) proactively devel-
oping contacts with point-of-care device innovators, national
reimbursement groups, health technology assessment agen-
cies, etc.; (3) establishing selection criteria for PoCT devices;
(4) establishing institutional-wide management, quality con-
trol, and quality assurance
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
procedures; and (5) promoting a
culture of cost-benefit and cost-effective analysis, thereby jus-
tifying the actual implementation of PoCT, including rapid
infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance PoCT. The
working group should ideally contain experts from the insti-
tution’s own diagnostic laboratories as well as representatives
of medical end-users, information technologists, pharmacists,
finance, and patients. Such PoCT working groups could also
act as a focal contact point for the
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
introduction of expert
knowledge into community healthcare settings.

On the level of antibiotic use, antibiotic stewardship teams
(A-Teams) have been installed in American and European
hospitals and conventionally include experts in internal med-
icine, microbiology, pharmacy, quality management, paediat-
rics, and intensive care (as needed). These teams work closely
with infection prevention specialists in reducing the inappro-
priate use of antibiotics within medical institutions.
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
However,
the added value of rapid infectious disease and antimicrobial
resistance PoCT to the antibiotic stewardship teams’ decision-
making processes may not be fully appreciated, even though
PoCT may provide an efficient approach for reducing the
evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance [3]. Here,
further education of the respective stakeholders is required,
as well as the addition of qualified molecular diagnosticians
to the antibiotic stewardship teams. Once implemented, it
would be
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
ideal if the A team were easily available, e.g. by
telephone, to answer questions from clinicians and nurses re-
garding AMR and AMR diagnostics.

At the individual level, the necessary implementation
changes required to make informed decisions on the use of
rapid infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance PoCT can
be simply focused on increasing the current knowledge of
medical professionals about the subject via a wide variety of
sources, including scientific publications, which in
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
general
will explain the lessons learnt from previously published in-
terventional studies. For example, Chandler et al. studied the
behavioural issues affecting the implementation of rapid ma-
laria testing and treatment in northern Tanzania [4]. The study
found that negative test results could lead to conflict situations
if a negative result meant that the health worker did not fulfil
the patient’s expectation of receiving malaria treatment.
Further, such malaria test negative patients may be
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
prescribed
antibiotics leading to an increase in the untargeted use of

Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2019) 38:1015–1022

1017

antibiotics [5]. Similar issues were identified in a study of C-
reactive protein (CRP) testing for lower respiratory tract in-
fections in Europe. These issues could have been addressed by
implementing online behaviour change interventions with in-
structions, training, and patient resources [6].

In a recent publication, Klein et al. employed psychology
to
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
investigate how the perceptions of clinicians influenced
their clinical decision-making process within emergency de-
partments [7]. Differences in the decision to prescribe antibi-
otics by emergency department clinicians could be related to
two possibly conflicting perceptions. These were ‘Why not
take a risk?’ and ‘Antibiotics may be harmful’. The results
reported in this study suggested that interventions to reduce
inappropriate prescribing should emphasise the possibility of
serious side
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
effects when prescribing antibiotics. Rapid infec-
tious disease and antimicrobial resistance PoCT educational
campaigns could therefore emphasise that prescribing antibi-
otics also carries a risk to the patient. However, whether such
perceptions are common to physicians within different coun-
tries, cultures or educational levels remains to be determined.
Whatever the method used, perhaps the best approach to
successfully implementing such testing is to avoid the learning
or adoption of ‘bad
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
behaviour’ in the first place. This process
is for example addressed by AMR DxC - The Antimicrobial
Resistance Challenge competition, an interdisciplinary initia-
tive whereby multi-disciplinary teams of young medical stu-
dents and early career scientists from different geographic
regions come together to discuss and work collaboratively
on medical diagnostic solutions. Cross-cutting interdisciplin-
ary discussions are key aspects of such programs, whereby
younger generations of clinicians,
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
diagnostic innovators, so-
cial scientists, and device designers discuss and understand
the current challenges associated with the development and
implementation of rapid infectious disease PoCT to tackle
antimicrobial resistance [8].

Mix-and-match implementation package
for rapid infectious disease and antimicrobial
resistance PoCT innovators

PoCT innovators can play a major role in ensuring the suc-
cessful adoption of infectious disease testing. As an example,
there is a current emphasis
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
on adapting and developing cutting
edge technologies for infectious disease diagnostics without
focusing on the actual clinical need for these technologies in
the detection of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resis-
tance. Therefore, innovators should establish bi-directional
communication channels with end-users and other stake-
holders. These groups should interact synergistically, forming
a positive feedback loop, whereby the changing needs of the
end-user generates adaptation in

diagnostic device develop-
ment. One method could include the use of online or email-

based questionnaires containing targeted questions that are
designed to shape the desired current and future performance
characteristics and settings of the device, thereby contributing
to the creation of specific target product profiles (TPP).
However, ideally, a range of methods is required to compre-
hensively understand user participation, possibly including
interviews, observational studies, and focus

group meetings
[9] For sustainability, rapid infectious disease and antimicro-
bial resistance PoCT innovators should obtain up-to-date in-
formation on infectious disease research and epidemiology via
regular visits to scientific conferences, accessing horizon
scanning reviews [10] or by asking for relevant information
from insurance companies, professional societies, patient as-
sociations, health technology assessment bodies, regulatory
bodies and global infectious disease alert systems such

Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
as
Promed (https://www.promedmail.org/).

Another large problem faced by innovators is the need for
strong evidence to confirm that their technologies can actually
improve current clinical practice, using evidence-based rather
than empirical medicine. In this context, evidence-based re-
lates to Bthe conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of cur-
rent best evidence in making decisions about the care of indi-
vidual patients^, andempirical to Bbased on, concerned with,
or verifiable by
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
observation or experience rather than theory or
pure logic^ [11] (https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/
empirical). The successful implementation of rapid infectious
disease and antimicrobial resistance PoCT will rely on
clinicians obtaining data from patient-centred studies that
compare and contrast the new diagnostic test with current gold
standard testing methods, considering inputs such as the costs
of training, devices, test kits, quality control, and assurance
schemes, as well as
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
outputs such as reduced antibiotic pre-
scribing costs, shorter hospitalisation, reduced antimicrobial
resistance, and improved quality of life [12]. To generate these
data, clinical studies need to be performed and the results
published in scientific journals. Further, summaries or short
information leaflets could form part of sales and marketing
campaigns to build user awareness. That said, it is appreciated
by the JPIAMR AMR-RDT working group that establishing
and conducting these studies
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
can be very expensive, especially
for innovators in small and medium-sized enterprises.
However, being trustworthy and open with consumers,
healthcare authorities, investors, and patients would help
avoid prominent crises, such as occurred with Theranos [13].
For further guidance, PoCT innovators should consult reg-
ulatory frameworks such as the latest In Vitro Diagnostic
Device Regulation (EU 2017/746) of the European Union
which also lays the legal framework for the European database
on
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
medical devices (EUDAMED) which by 2020 will facili-
tate access to information on existing diagnostics (http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%
3A32017R0746). To succeed with the development of viable
products, innovators need to consider business-to-business

1018

Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2019) 38:1015–1022

implementation strategies. Ultimately, innovators need to be
able to invest in manufacturing facilities, salaries, marketing,
etc., and clinicians need to be
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
able to use PoCT with confi-
dence of an improved health economic benefit.

A lack of standardised national and international reim-
bursement schemes is currently reducing the potential imple-
mentation and impact of PoCT. This effect is not only restrict-
ed to traditional healthcare settings, but also involves potential
new markets such as home-based care, telemedicine, and in-
home testing and monitoring, where some form of reimburse-
ment is essential [14]. In some countries, clinicians are
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
funded
via a national healthcare service, which may be prepared to
pay for in-house medical testing, for example for PoCT per-
formed at a general practitioner’s office [15]. However,
though patient healthcare insurance may be available in some
countries, not everyone can afford to pay basic healthcare
insurance premiums, and a choice may have to be made be-
tween paying for a PoCT or simply buying antibiotics. In this
respect, evidence of added value is essential and innovators
could encourage
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
the implementation of their diagnostics by
being flexible in their pricing strategy, for example, by basing
their prices on the number of tests sold. Also, cooperation with
product development partnerships and/or non-governmental
organisations are other possible options for promoting sales
and reimbursement, including for example the establish-
ment of ‘Diagnostic Market Stimulus Pots’ to ‘ensure a
market based revenue stream for developers’ [16]. In any
case, finding funding for healthcare
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
validation studies is
one of the major challenges facing all developers of
healthcare diagnostics.

Gender and cultural issues may also play a major role in
preventing the implementation of PoCT due to the
stigmatisation of patients found to be infected with a particular
pathogen—not forgetting that stigmatisation could also be
based on a false positive test result. For example, a positive
human immunodeficiency virus, sexually transmitted disease,
Ebola, etc., test result may be utilised to
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
justify existing prej-
udices or beliefs based on gender, sexual preference, or immi-
gration status [17]. Further, Borg identified behaviour charac-
teristics related to Bcultures that are low in uncertainty avoid-
ance and power distance, and high in individualism and
masculinity^ that could influence PoCT implementation strat-
egies [18]. Whilst it is not feasible for, or indeed the respon-
sibility of, diagnostics innovators to change an individual’s or
culture’s beliefs or prejudices,
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
innovators must be sympathetic
and knowledgeable about their target population. In this re-
spect, one possible route for accessing potentially stigmatised
communities would be to approach the community via a
trusted intermediary, who may be a community opinion lead-
er, local tribal elder, or a religious leader.

If we consider the future expansion of healthcare, then it is
not unreasonable to assume that some form of PoCT will
eventually be routinely used by members of the public,
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
via

pharmacies or at home, without the supervision of a medical
professional. To prevent confusion by the pharmacist or end-user,
as well as unnecessary visits to already overworked family doc-
tors, pharmacists, and emergency departments, PoCT innovators
should ideally establish telephone or internet hotlines that are
available to answer the questions of pharmacists or PoCT device
home-based users. These hotlines could potentially form addi-
tional arms of existing medical information
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
hotlines, for example
the UK NHS 111 service (www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/
AboutNHSservices/Emergencyandurgentcareservices/Pages/
NHS-111.aspx). Further, by collecting data from such
services, hotline providers could generate essential
feedback to diagnostics innovators that could be used to
increase device performance or improve the simplicity of
instruction material supplied with the diagnostic. However, it
should be noted that performing PoCT at the pharmacy or at
home is a controversial issue.
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
For example, a recent pharmacy
‘test and treat’ scheme for sore throat diagnosis in England
attracted some criticism regarding poor sensitivity and lack of
a full cost-effectiveness analysis [19]. Finally, diagnostics in-
novators should gain a deep understanding of the context and
views of potential end-users before product development pro-
gresses into a functional and marketable device, for example,
using established ‘user-centred’, ‘participatory design’, or
‘person-based’ approaches.
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
Innovators should not simply fo-
cus on the development of ‘technology for technology’s sake’.
Just because a technology exists that could be adapted for
PoCT, does not mean to say that the technology will ultimately
be successful as a healthcare diagnostic.

Mix-and-match implementation package
for the general public

Promoting change in the standard practice of clinical medicine
has traditionally been achieved by actively targeting clini-
cians, with the possible exception of vaccination
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
campaigns
that are designed to encourage the general public to vaccinate
themselves and their children against a range of infectious
diseases. However, the realisation that the world is ap-
proaching an antimicrobial resistance catastrophe where clin-
ically relevant microorganisms are resistant to all available
antibiotics has led to global efforts to educate the general
public about the dangers of the misuse of antibiotics. These
educational efforts need to include information on the value
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
of
PoCT in helping reduce untargeted antibiotic prescribing prac-
tices. In this respect, PoCT educational material/campaigns
could be generated that are aimed at the general public via
hospital and family doctor leaflets, radio/newspaper/TV ad-
vertisements, etc. Slogans adapted from existing infectious
disease diagnostic companies or new slogans such as ‘Lack
of a diagnostic result? Unnecessary antibiotics during the con-
sult!’ could be used. Additionally, the general public should be

Eur
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2019) 38:1015–1022

encouraged to think about the consequences of antibiotic pre-
scribing on themselves (for example the ‘collateral damage’
caused by antibiotics to the patient’s own protective mi-
crobiota) and on their own extended families and com-
munities (for example the threat of growing worldwide
antimicrobial resistance on communities in which their
family members live). Such educational material should
take into account the education level,
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
geography, and
religious belief of the target audience.

Perhaps health warnings could be added to packets of an-
tibiotics that would indicate that antibiotics should ideally
only be taken after a positive (PoCT) test result has been
obtained [20]. Such warnings may help generate a mental link
between a lack of accurate diagnosis and the incorrect/over-
prescribing of antibiotics. Such a link could persuade patients
to discuss diagnostic issues with their clinician before receiv-
ing
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
antibiotics. However, it should be noted that in order to be
effective, the content of such health warnings should address
the patients’ own beliefs, for example, a belief that they them-
selves are not at risk from antimicrobial resistant infections or
that their behaviour may not be contributing to the increase
and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

Mix-and-match implementation
considerations for long-term viability (future
proofing)

The long-term viability of PoCT may be affected by, for
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
ex-
ample: (1) genomic mutations in pathogenic microorganisms;
(2) the emergence of new antimicrobial resistance traits; (3)
antigenic shifts related to the introduction of new vaccines; (4)
the spread of previously unknown pathogenic microorgan-
isms to humans and domesticated animals, and (5) the creation
of new ecological niches due to global climate change.
Therefore, regular adaptation of diagnostic devices (future
proofing) will be necessary to ensure that their added value
is actually
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
sustainable. Accurately predicting the future is
always difficult, but armed with a few simple concepts
(described below), both innovators and end-users may be
able to adapt their current behaviour so as to plan for, and
reap, the potential rewards available from the long-term
viability of PoCT.

PoCT innovators and (inter)national health authorities
should be aware that decentralisation may bring with it new
(exploitable) possibilities. For example, the use of telemedi-
cine may facilitate the
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
interpretation of results by clinicians far
away from the site where a patient is being tested, as well as
the ability to collect global infectious disease test results in real
time during disease outbreaks. However, these exploitable
possibilities bring with them potential problems such as pa-
tient authorisation, investment in large-scale data storage cen-
tres and management, data security, and ethical issues.

Smartphone ownership is ubiquitous and the rate of
smartphone ownership in
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
emerging economies and develop-
ing countries has been increasing at an extraordinary rate. This
rise in the ownership of smartphones has been accompanied
by a rise in the development of both software and hardware
applications in the field of rapid PoCT diagnostics, for exam-
ple, the Colorimetrix app (portable spectrophotometer), the
smartphone ‘Olloclip’ lens (microscopy), and smartphone
‘Otoscope’ (ear infections). Additionally, large steps are being
made in the rapid nucleotide sequencing
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
of pathogens using
portable devices, facilitating the generation of so-called
‘omics’-based data including genomics and transcriptomics
data (https://nanoporetech.com/). Further, although possible
discrepancies between genomic and phenotypic data
currently exist, future advances in the transcriptomic
sequencing of mRNA transcripts may provide the necessary
link between genomic data and phenotypic characteristics of
infectious disease pathogens [21].

As ‘omics-based’ data becomes more abundant,
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
it is ex-
pected that machine learning (i.e. the ability of computers to
learn without being explicitly programmed to do a task), will
become increasingly relevant to behaviour change in clinical
settings. In this respect, clinical decision support systems
(CDSS) incorporated in, or connected to, PoCT diagnostics
may help clinicians to (1) distinguish between viral and bac-
terial infections; (2) assess regional and personalised antimi-
crobial resistance profiles; (3) improve antibiotic
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
prescribing
practices, and (4) predict a patient’s response to treatment
[22]. However, the integration of machine learning into clin-
ical practice requires a combination of accuracy, predictive
power, and interpretability. This will require the establishment
of interdisciplinary expert panels and clinical trials, rather than
simply relying on computer technologists to write algorithms
and publish their results. That said, the importance of artificial
intelligence in the detection and
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
validation of clinical bio-
markers in infectious disease diagnosis has been highlighted
by the winner of the XPRIZE (https://tricorder.xprize.org/
prizes/tricorder/articles/family-led-team-takes-top-prize-in-
qualcomm-tricor). The winner recently received $2·6 million
for an artificial intelligence-based engine ‘DxtER’, which con-
sists of Ba group of non-invasive sensors that are designed to
collect data about vital signs, body chemistry and biological
functions. This information is then
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
synthesised in the device’s
diagnostic engine to make a quick and accurate assessment^.
This type of development points to a future where individ-
ual PoCT diagnostics may become redundant to new more
powerful diagnostics that are able to diagnose many dif-
ferent infectious and non-communicable diseases together
and potentially predict treatment outcomes in a more cost-
effective manner.

Decentralisation and the ability to transmit data over vast
distances, whilst simultaneously being able to
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
link many thou-
sands of diagnostic devices with each other, could be

1020

Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2019) 38:1015–1022

profoundly advantageous for the health of citizens and na-
tions. The worldwide implementation and connectivity of
PoCT diagnostics could lead to advances in holistic healthcare
monitoring, with such devices regularly communicating with
each other—exchanging patient information, clinical histo-
ries, cardiology data, X-rays, tomography results, etc.
Additionally, by
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
blending the results of such data with data
collected from environmental, ecological, meteorological,
and entomological sources, new multi-dimensional algo-
rithms could be developed for high-level predictive model-
ling of the origin and spread of existing and emerging in-
fectious diseases. Such global healthcare networks and algo-
rithms could also act as early warning systems for the rapid
detection of epidemics, allowing the targeted distribution of
healthcare resources to affected areas
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
[23]. Examples include
(1) modelling and predicting the effect of global warming
and urbanisation on infectious diseases, such as the spread

of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV popula-
tions; (2) monitoring the spread of mosquito borne diseases
from Africa into Europe; (3) determining the genotype of
currently circulating strains of influenza in their seasonal
progression around the world; and (4) monitoring the health
of migrant and refugee populations. To be
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
feasible,
standardised data collection, databases, data exchange, pri-
vacy protocols, and cybersecurity issues will have to be
implemented, especially in an age of connectivity via the
Internet of Things. However, it should be noted that saving
costs on data security in an age of PoCT diagnostic connec-
tivity could potentially result in poorly protected devices
with vulnerabilities that leave them open to hacking and
malware

Conclusions

Infectious diseases are one of the major contributors to global
morbidity and mortality. In this respect, the successful imple-
mentation of rapid PoCT into healthcare settings has the po-
tential to help
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
slow down and prevent the global spread of
infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistances. This can be
achieved by better monitoring of infections and by facilitating
the accurate and targeted prescribing of antibiotics to those
patients who actually need them. However, it should be noted
that the successful implementation and long-term viability of
rapid infectious disease and antibiotic resistance PoCT is not
solely dependent on the development, sales, and marketing of
diagnostic devices.
----
Source: 10096_2019_Article_3492.pdf
Instead, a more sophisticated and holistic
approach is required that takes the opinions and requirements
of end-users into account, whilst remaining technologically
flexible in order to meet the demands of future trends.
Consideration of the ‘mix-and-match’ implementation change
package described in this publication will help facilitate the
uptake and sustainability of PoCT diagnostics into healthcare
settings. Successful implementation will be a key step in re-
ducing the spread and
----

development of antibiotic resistant in-
fections, helping improve global healthcare outcomes in terms
of patient morbidity and mortality.

Abstract

Background:
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
Antimicrobial resistance generates a huge health and economic burden and has the potential to
become the leading cause of death globally, but its underlying drivers are yet to be fully described. The association
between a microbe’s exposure to antimicrobials and subsequent development of, or selection for, resistance is well
documented, as are the exacerbating microbial and human factors. However, the nature and extent of this risk, and
how it varies by antimicrobial class and duration of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
treatment, is poorly defined. The goal of our systematic review and
network meta-analysis is to determine the relationship between the duration of antimicrobial exposure and selection
for resistance. We will use macrolides as the antimicrobial class of interest and Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage as an
indicator organism. Our secondary outcomes include duration of symptoms, risk of treatment failure and recurrence,
and descriptions of resistance mechanisms.

Methods: We will conduct a
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
systematic review, selecting studies if they are published randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
which report the relationship between taking a macrolide for any indication and incidence of resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae in patients of any age group. We will use a predefined search strategy to identify studies meeting these
eligibility criteria in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of RCTs. Two authors will
independently screen titles and abstracts, review the
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
full texts and undertake data extraction. We will use the Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool to assess the quality of included RCTs. If feasible, we will perform pair-wise meta-analysis modelling to
determine the relationship between the duration of macrolide treatment and development of macrolide resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae. If the identified studies meet the assumptions for a network meta-analysis (NMA), we will
additionally model this relationship using indirect comparisons. Our protocol
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
utilises reporting guidance by Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and the extensions for protocols (PRISMA-P) and
network meta-analyses (PRISMA for NMA). Our review will also report to these standards.

synthetic molecules with
cytotoxic or cytostatic abilities against microbes—are
one of the greatest medical discoveries [1]. Unfortu-
nately, their usefulness is limited by the inherent genetic
capacity of microbes to rapidly develop, transfer and ac-
quire resistance-causing mutations [2, 3]. Unnecessary
prescription in medical settings, as well as extensive
agricultural use, contributes substantially to overall anti-
biotic drug pressure globally [4–6]. The current era is
characterised by

Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
sharply declining investment from the
pharmaceutical industry in the development of effective
new antimicrobials; far fewer new compounds are devel-
oped annually now than during the 1990s [7].

In 2016, antimicrobial resistance became one of only
four health topics ever to be discussed at the United Na-
tions General Assembly [8], reflecting its huge health and
economic burden [9, 10]. Drug resistance is projected to
become the leading cause of death by 2050 [11].

The development of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
antimicrobial resistance is,
to
some extent, inevitable. Billions of doses of antibiotics
are taken globally each year. Each human hosts a micro-
biome of approximately 3.8 × 1013 bacteria [12], and
there is spontaneous (i.e. unselected) drug-resistance
−4
within this microbiome at a frequency as high as 10
mutations, depending upon the type of antimicrobial
[13–15]. Under drug pressure, resistance can then be
amplified and transmitted through a variety of mecha-
nisms [2]. Despite these risks,

because they are often sufficient to cure the patient and
they reduce immediate costs and adverse events.

There is unambiguous evidence that the development
of, or selection for, resistance occurs following anti-
microbial exposure [4, 16–18]. The duration of treat-

To explore this relationship and derive high-quality
evidence, it is necessary

to choose an antimicrobial or
class of antimicrobials with which patients are treated,
an indicator organism in which drug resistance develops
and a uniform method for assessing resistance. Macro-
lides are one of the most prescribed antimicrobials in
clinical practice [20, 21], which act by inhibiting bacter-

Our aim, therefore, is to conduct a systematic review
using data

from published RCTs to determine the rela-
tionship between the duration of antimicrobial exposure
and the development of, or selection for, resistance using
carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae as an indicator or-
ganism. We will evaluate studies involving healthy indi-
viduals or patients with any illness
treated with
macrolide antimicrobials in whom the development of,
or selection for, antimicrobial resistance was assessed
using Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage. We have opted
to use

Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
network meta-analysis (NMA) as the preferred
evidence
because RCTs with
head-to-head comparisons of different durations of
macrolides will
likely be too rare for a meaningful

direct and indirect evidence and are hence the most effi-

Methods
Protocol and registration
The protocol for this planned systematic review is regis-
tered with the International Prospective Register of System-
atic Reviews (PROSPERO), CRD42018089275.

Eligibility criteria
We will include studies that fulfil the following criteria:

5. Study design: RCTs. Restricting to RCTs will

minimise confounding.

6. Language and time limitations: We will include

studies published in any language and on any date.
For articles in languages
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
other than English that are
eligible for full-text review, we will seek assistance
from a native speaker who has been trained in data
extraction using an article published in English.

1. Population: healthy individuals or patients of any

illness or age, treated with macrolide antimicrobials.
We will record participant characteristics, including
age, sex and the indication for treatment.
Interventions: Any macrolide antimicrobial being
given as monotherapy, via any route, for

Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
respiratory
infections. We are interested in the impact of
macrolide treatment on antimicrobial resistance in
Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage. We will record
the specific macrolide, dose and duration reported
in each study. Registered macrolides include
azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin,
fidaxomicin, telithromycin, carbomycin a,
josamycin, kitasamycin, midecamycin, midecamycin
acetate, oleandomycin, solithromycin, spiramycin,
troleandomycin, tylosin, tylocine and
roxithromycin.

3.
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
Comparators: Other macrolides, other

antimicrobials, placebo, or no treatment.
Macrolides are commonly used for respiratory tract
infections, and amoxicillin and doxycycline are
expected to be the most frequent non-macrolide
comparators.

4. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the
incidence/risk of macrolide resistance in
Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage among
individuals in whom this did not exist before
commencing macrolide treatment. Macrolide
resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae

results from
either ribosomal dimethylation by an enzyme
encoded by erm(B), efflux by a two-component efflux
pump encoded by mef (E)/mel(msr(D)), or mutations
of the ribosomal target site of macrolides [33]. We
will include studies that utilised any established
laboratory method to demonstrate evidence of
macrolide resistance.

Our secondary outcomes include the duration of
symptoms (number of symptomatic days from com-
failure

treatment

therapy),

risk of

In NMA geometry, competing interventions are repre-

the duration of exposure to any macrolide used in the
included RCTs (Fig. 1). We will classify treatment dur-
ation as brief if it is ≤ 5 days, short if it is 6 to 10 days,
it is > 10 days. These durations are
and prolonged if
based on an understanding of the current clinical use of
macrolides, which are dosed for up to 5 days for com-
munity acquired pneumonia, up to 10 days for
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
severe
pneumonia, and for prolonged periods of time for in-
flammatory respiratory illnesses such as cystic fibrosis
and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Within the net-
work, the lines joining nodes are termed edges and are
drawn to a thickness that graphically represents the an-
ticipated amount of evidence or number of comparisons
that we expect to find between the particular nodes. For
example,
it is likely that more RCTs will compare a
macrolide to a control than to another macrolide of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
a
different duration. NMAs will allow us to compare dif-
ferent durations of macrolide exposure (brief, short and
prolonged) by computing indirect comparisons, provided
that any patient meeting our eligibility criteria would,
theoretically, have been equally likely to be randomised
to any of the interventions of the studies included in the
network.

Information sources and search strategy
We will search for studies that meet the eligibility criteria
in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Web of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
Science
and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL: The Cochrane Library). MEDLINE, Embase and
Global Health will be searched using the Ovid platform.
Papers will not be excluded on the basis of the language of
publication and time frame in which they were published.
We will only include data from peer-reviewed papers in
order to ensure scientific quality.

In Table 1, we present our search strategy for MED-
LINE, which we will adapt for the other databases. This

Data extraction
Publication information will be exported from Endnote
into a standardised extraction form in Microsoft Excel
Data will be extracted into (Additional file 1). This form
is currently in draft format; it will be finalised among the
study team once it has been trialled by two people
extracting the same five papers. After finalisation of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
the
form, two team members will extract the data independ-
ently. Discrepancies will
initially be discussed and re-
solved between the two team members, with a third
team member available to resolve disputes. Multiple
publications arising from the same study will be com-
bined. Where data gaps are present, the original study
authors will be contacted. Once the extraction phase is
complete, data will be exported into the analysis
software.

Data for assessing methodological comparability of

trials
In addition to the data necessary for outcome evaluation,
we will extract information on any interventions, or
study or population characteristics that may act as effect
modifiers, as is necessary for the assessment of the as-
sumptions of the NMA. These are:

1. Methods: study design, randomisation (individual or

centres and location, study setting, withdrawals and
date of study.

Risk of bias assessment
We will conduct a risk of bias assessment at the level of
the study. We will use the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias
tool for randomised trials (RoB 2.0), the recommended
method for assessing

experimental studies [34]. The risk
of bias assessment tool interrogates various aspects of
selection and information bias. It involves assessing how
the allocation sequence was generated, how it was con-
cealed, if blinding was done, how outcomes were ascer-
tained, the quality of follow up, and whether there was
selective outcome reporting. The risk of bias assessment
will be done independently by two reviewers and dis-
agreements resolved by discussion or by third reviewer.

analysis
Guiding counterfactual model
Our analysis will strive, as far as possible, to mimic the
counterfactual framework presented in Fig. 2. The ideal
study for addressing the primary outcome is one that re-
cruits AMR-free participants of similar demographics,
randomises them (1:1:1) to receiving any of the three du-
rations of the same macrolide antimicrobial (brief, short
and prolonged), and then follows them for the same dur-
ation before assessing for AMR using the same tech-
nique.
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
Restricting to the same type of macrolide
antimicrobial would limit the impact of the inherent dif-
ferences in the intervention itself. For example, within
the macrolide class, the drugs have different bioavailabil-
ity and half-lives; this may impact the development of,
or selection for, resistance. Additionally, different dosing,
routes of administration, and strength of activity against
S. pneumoniae are other sources of variability. Further-
more, an optimal study would assess outcomes in
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
each
arm at the same time relative to the end of treatment
(e.g. 1 day post-treatment), as macrolide AMR has been
shown to decrease with time from last date of treatment.
The use of the same technique would ensure compar-
ability of results between arms.

review is unlikely. Our final statistical analysis plan will
therefore be a calculated trade-off of these ideal conditions.

Study and network characteristics
Data will initially be analysed using descriptive statistics,
including all the variables described above, in addition
to reporting the comparisons performed in each study,
indications for antimicrobial therapy, participant charac-
teristics, study setting, and methodological approaches.

We will prepare a network diagram (similar to
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
the
hypothetical diagram shown in Fig. 1) in which the size
of the nodes reflect the total number of patients rando-
mised to each intervention, the thickness of edges is pro-
portional to the number of direct comparisons, and the
colour of each edge will represent the risk of bias. We
will use a contribution matrix to understand and rank
the influence of various comparisons in the network on
the final summary data [35, 36].

Pair-wise and network meta-analysis
If sufficiently methodologically
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
homogeneous studies are
identified, we will perform pair-wise meta-analysis for the
primary outcome using either fixed effects or random ef-
fects modelling approaches, depending on the extent of
heterogeneity. We will assess the extent of heterogeneity
using the Cochran Q2 and I2 statistics. We will convey the
extent of heterogeneity visually using a forest plot.

Next, we will assess whether the identified studies meet
the assumptions for a NMA. Apart from having reason-
ably homogeneous
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
methodologies, the key assumption for
ensuring validity of inferences drawn from indirect com-
parisons within a network is transitivity; the balance of the

distributions of patient and study characteristics across
studies. Initially, we will determine if this assumption is
fulfilled by conducting a qualitative review of the RCT
characteristics described earlier (‘Data extraction’ section).
For the subset of eligible studies in which the transitivity
assumption holds, we will assume that each
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
of their pa-
tients were equally likely to be randomised to any of the
antimicrobial agents and treatment durations being inves-
tigated, thus establishing the basis for the indirect compar-
isons. Fixed and random effects NMAs will then be used
to synthesise all the evidence for the primary outcome
and to rank included treatments. To identify the appropri-
ate model between fixed and random effects NMAs for
our data, we will use the deviance information criteria
(DIC) to assess their
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
goodness-of-fit. The summary effect
measures for all pairwise comparisons will be presented in
a league table. We will rank the risk of AMR with various
treatments using the surface under the cumulative ranking
curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks [37].

Consistency within the network—the agreement be-
tween direct and indirect evidence—will be assessed
within each loop of evidence using loop-specific approach
[38] and by employing a global method for evaluating the
whole network [39]. We will also
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
estimate the I2 for net-
work heterogeneity and inconsistency [40, 41], but we will
exercise caution when interpreting the results, considering
the well-established limitations in power [42]. We will use
funnel plot to assess for publication bias.

Additional analyses
We will perform subgroup, meta-regression and sensitiv-
ity NMA analyses. The subgroup analyses will involve
stratified by study-level
running the NMA model

Discussion
Our systematic review will use published RCTs of
macrolide antimicrobials to establish the relationship be-
tween the duration of antimicrobial exposure and the
development of, or selection for, resistance using upper
respiratory tract carriage of
----
Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
Streptococcus pneumoniae,
isolated from patients with respiratory symptoms, as

indicator organism. This will inform the design of anti-
microbial prescriptions, treatment guidelines and the be-
haviour of both physicians and patients. This work
therefore will therefore be an important contribution to-
wards the realisation of current antimicrobial resistance
control strategies [19].

Where possible, through our secondary objectives, we
will attempt to describe the clinical outcomes

with different macrolide durations. Our results on these

The strengths of our review include publication of the
full protocol with PROSPERO and in this peer-reviewed
article, with detailed methodology laid out a priori. The
internal validity of our review is safeguarded by our re-
striction of the study type to RCTs. The quality and
transparency of our work are ensured by our adherence
to both PRISMA and PRISMA NMA

Source: 13643_2018_Article_917.pdf
guidelines.

The conclusions of our NMA will be weakened if dir-
ect comparisons are rare, leading to an overreliance on
indirect comparisons. Heterogeneity may be introduced
by our broad participant population (all ages, any indica-
tion of treatment), global coverage (any setting) and un-
limited study period. We will seek to limit this by adding
study-level covariates to the NMA model, if required.

To our knowledge, our review and NMA will be the
first attempt to systematically examine the

association
between the duration of exposure to macrolide antimi-
crobials and subsequent development of, or selection for,

Abstract

Background: The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance is the most urgent current

threat to human and
animal health. An improved understanding of the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes and genes associated
with microbial colonisation and pathogenicity in the animal gut will have a major role in reducing the contribution of
animal production to this problem. Here, the influence of diet on the ruminal resistome and abundance of pathogenicity
genes was assessed in ruminal digesta samples taken from 50 antibiotic-free beef cattle, comprising four cattle breeds
receiving

two diets containing different proportions of concentrate.

Results: Two hundred and four genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR), colonisation, communication or
pathogenicity functions were identified from 4966 metagenomic genes using KEGG identification. Both the diversity and
abundance of these genes were higher in concentrate-fed animals. Chloramphenicol and microcin resistance genes were
dominant in samples from forage-fed animals (P < 0.001), while aminoglycoside and

enriched in concentrate-fed animals. The concentrate-based diet also increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria,
which includes many animal and zoonotic pathogens. A high ratio of Proteobacteria to (Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes) was
confirmed as a good indicator for rumen dysbiosis, with eight cases all from concentrate-fed animals. Finally, network
analysis demonstrated that the resistance/pathogenicity genes are potentially useful as biomarkers for health

Conclusions: Diet has important effects on the complement of AMR genes in the rumen microbial community, with
potential implications for human and animal health.

Background
Two significant challenges face mankind in the near future.
The first is to feed a human population that may soon

problems arising from
the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) patho-
genic bacteria [2]. Ruminant livestock production is highly
relevant to both issues. Ruminants consume feedstuffs,
including forages and by-products that cannot be used by

quality nutrients from materials that do not compete

with
human-edible food. However, the ruminant digestive tract
contains AMR genes that may be a reservoir from which
AMR develops and spreads [2–4]. The use of antimicrobial
feed additives increases the abundance of AMR genes in
the gut and faeces [4, 5], particularly in beef cattle [3, 6].
Indeed, more antimicrobials are used in livestock produc-
tion than in human therapeutics [7]. AMR genes in the ru-
minant gut are not entirely due to antimicrobial use, but
appear also in non-medicated

composition of the ruminal microbiome [10, 11], we con-
sidered that the absence of knowledge about the influence
of diet on the ruminal “resistome” (the collection of all
identified antibiotic resistance genes) was a deficiency in
understanding how AMR
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
develops and spreads in live-
stock. A diet change (e.g. forage to concentrate) could gen-
erate a stress for the rumen microbiome community [12]
as similarly found in humans by Brown et al. [13]. Thus,
we analysed metagenomics data from beef cattle which
had previously been used to explore links between the host
animal, its microbiome/metagenome and methane emis-
sions and feed efficiency.

Dietary changes could also potentially initiate a “bloom”
of specific microbial populations, mostly
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
Proteobacteria
[14], or enhance the abundance of stress-response genes
within the microbial community [15]. This unbalanced
microbial community, also known as “dysbiosis”, is gener-
ally observed after diet changes and alterations in ruminal
volatile fatty acid (VFA) composition also potentially
associated with a lower ruminal pH, antibiotic treatment,
presence of heavy metals or toxic substances or infection
with pathogenic bacteria [13, 16]. For example, a low acet-
ate to propionate (A:P <
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
2.2) ratio is associated with a lower
ruminal pH in animals offered a high-concentrate diet [17].
All of these factors can have negative effects on the overall
health and production performance of cattle [18, 19].
Proteobacteria is one of the four main phyla in the rumen
microbiome together with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and
Actinobacteria. This phylum is composed of many patho-
genic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and the abundance
of some of these opportunistic pathogens is sensitive
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
to
dietary change [20]. Diet has been shown to have a domin-
ant effect on the shedding of the zoonotic pathogen, E. coli
O157, from beef cattle [21]. Thus, the combined effects of
pathogen abundance and the abundance and diversity of
AMR genes have fundamental
implications for human
health.

Finally, microbial mechanisms including quorum sens-
ing and fucose sensing [22, 23] are recognised as inter-
kingdom signalling pathways [24] and help to regulate
bacterial colonisation and virulence

Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
within the host [25].
Our study design allowed us to test the impact of diet
(“concentrate” versus “forage”) and host influence (e.g. breed,
age or weight) on the ruminal microbiota and functional
genes associated with the microbiome [26]. Metagenomics
was already confirmed as a good strategy to identify links be-
tween the rumen microbiome and host response [20, 27].

Therefore, the overall aim of our work was to improve
knowledge on the diversity and importance of resistance-
and
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
pathogenicity-related genes as well as microbiome-
host interaction genes in the rumen microbial community
affected by diet treatments and over three independent tri-
als. The factors influencing the composition of these genes
in the rumen microbiome were evaluated, and the genes

showing significant differences were identified. We
hypothesised that the microbiome of cattle offered a
concentrate-based diet will favour stress associated with
acidotic challenge and therefore enriched in

microbial
genes related to the resistome or pathogenicity activities,
when compared to the cattle offered the forage-based diet.
Rumen samples with higher Proteobacteria content,
reaching a dysbiosis state, were of particular interest for
understanding its association with diet treatments and
how this can be explained by enrichment of the targeted
genes. We also tried to identify a possible link between
these genes and the control that the host has on its micro-
biome. This could be an
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
important step towards identify-
ing novel biomarkers of possible host-microbiome
interactions involving beneficial and detrimental effects
on the health of the host and related to diet change.

Methods
Animals, experimental design and diets
In our previous study [26, 28], data on feed efficiency and
methane emissions (measured using respiration chambers)
were obtained from a 2 × 2 factorial design experiment of
breed types and diets using 72 steers from a two-breed ro-
tational cross between
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
Aberdeen Angus (AA) and Limou-
sin (LIM) and completed in 2011. Similar experiments
were repeated using purebred Luing (LU) and crossbred
Charolais (CH) steers in 2013 and Aberdeen Angus (AA)
and Limousin (LIM) rotational crossbred steers in 2014.
Prior to start of the experiment, all animals received the
same diet type (forage-based diet) and thereafter were
adapted to the experimental diets over 5 weeks. During
the same period, they were also acclimatised to the group-
housed environment and

the electronic feeders (HOKO,
Insentec, Marknesse, The Netherlands). Due to EU legisla-
tion, the application of antibiotics is prohibited for enhan-
cing growth. In exceptional cases, animals were treated
with antibiotics and then excluded from the trial. Finally,
there was no change in diets of the animals and was no
fasting period before the animals went to slaughter.

The data in this study were samples from those experi-
ments whereby animals with extreme high and low me-
thane emissions
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
(2011) or feed conversion efficiency (2013
and 2014) were selected for whole genome sequencing.
The breed type of the sampled progenies were balanced
within experiment comprising of 4 AA and LIM in 2011, 9
LU and CH in 2013 and 12 AA and LIM in 2014. The ani-
mals were offered two complete diets ad libitum contain-
ing (g/kg DM)
to 500
concentrate or 80 forage to 920 concentrate subsequently
referred to as forage and concentrate diets, respectively
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Full details of

diets are given
in Rooke et al. [11] and Duthie et al. [29, 30]. Animals
from the 2014 experiment were only offered the forage diet
(see Additional file 1: Table S1), and this experiment was

approximately 500 forage

included in our analysis to increase observations for the for-
age diet, which is more heterogeneous in composition than
the concentrate diet and to reinforce the microbiome re-
sults obtained with similar forage diets for

the 2011 and
2013 experiments. A single sample of rumen fluid for VFA
analysis (expressed as molar proportions) was taken by
stomach tube within 1 h of cattle leaving the respiration
chambers in the 2011 experiment [11]. VFA were deter-
mined for 2013 and 2014 in samples collected directly at
the abattoir [11]. As recommended by Terré et al. [31], we
compared VFA profiles between samples rather than total
VFA concentrations because of the different methods for
rumen sampling applied. The
----

acetate-to-propionate ratio
was calculated and considered as a proxy for rumen pH,
accepting that whilst the relationship between the two is
generally strong, it is not exactly linear. A total of 50 ani-
mals including the 8 animals already studied in Roehe et al.
[26], selected and balanced for breed type and diet, were
used for further analyses (Additional file 1: Table S1). Post-
mortem digesta samples were used here, following our pre-
vious discovery that the abundance of archaea relative
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
to
bacteria was similar between live and slaughter cattle [32].

Genomic analysis
As previously described in Roehe et al. [26], the animals
were slaughtered in a commercial abattoir where two
rumen fluid samples (approximately 50 mL) were taken
immediately after the rumen was opened to be drained.
DNA was extracted from the rumen samples following
the protocol described in Rooke et al. [11].

Illumina TruSeq libraries were prepared from genomic
DNA and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq systems

(2011) and 4000 (2013, 2014) by Edinburgh Genomics.
Further analyses using the two sets of data followed the
same procedure as previously described in Roehe et al.
[26]. Briefly, microbial
functional genes encoding for
proteins and including the genes detailed in this study
were identified using the KEGG genes database. Genes
with a relative abundance of more than 0.001% were se-
lected for further analysis.

A specific analysis was carried out on antimicrobial re-
sistance genes and a
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
comparison between the annotation
obtained using KEGG genes and the genotyping tool
SRST2 associated with the ARG-ANNOT database was
performed; the latter was created specifically to study
AMR genes [33, 34]. ARG-ANNOT targets all AMR
genes including those on the chromosome and offers the
possibility to identify putative new AMR genes in bacter-
ial genomes as well as the genes involved in regulatory
function associated with the AMR genes [35] and still
showing high sensitivity and specificity
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
for these genes,
similar to other databases (e.g. ResFinder database) [36].
As for the analysis of metagenomics data using KEGG,
a matrix was generated using the depth values and

normalising the relative abundance of each AMR genes
per sample. The length and coverage values for AMR
genes were on average 1386 ± 26 bp and 99.31 ± 0.08%
respectively.

For 16S rRNA gene analysis, the genomic reads were
aligned to the GREENGENES database [37] using Novoa-
lign (www.novocraft.com). The
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
Proteobacteria ratio was
calculated as the abundance of Proteobacteria sequences
divided by the sum of the abundance of Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes sequences and is used as indicator for micro-
bial disorder in both the rumen of cattle and human intes-
tines [12, 14]. Values equivalent or above 0.19 were
considered as an indication of the microbial disorder also
known as dysbiosis. This cut-off value was calculated based
on the abundance of the bacterial phyla identified in the
core rumen
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
microbiome of cattle fed forage or concentrate
diets [12] and confirmed as a marker of microbial dysbiosis
in the human gut [14].

Parameters were adjusted such that all hits were re-
ported that were equal in quality to the best hit for each
read, and allowing up to a 10% mismatch across the frag-
ment. Further details are included in Roehe et al. [26].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the metagenomic data was based on
the complete sample profiles as expressed by the pattern
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
of
metagenomic operational functional units (OFUs) and the
relative abundance (percentage) of individual OFU in each
profile. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical
variate analysis (CVA) were carried out using Gen-Stat
16th edition (VSN International Ltd., UK) to identify the
factor(s) explaining the difference observed in microbial
functional genes between samples. In CVA, each factor was
tested individually in order to get a more constrained
analysis.

Microbial functional gene
----

abundances were compared
individually or within a functional group (e.g. all genes as-
sociated with antibiotic resistance) using a general linear
model with adjustment for multiple comparisons using the
Bonferroni correction (SPSS Statistics 22, IBM, USA).
Spearman’s correlations were carried out using SPSS Statis-
tics 22 (IBM, USA) to identify the correlation between the
AMR gene groups and Proteobacteria phylum or ratio, as
well as between the Proteobacteria ratio and 20 Proteobac-
teria

families or genera. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered
significant and tendencies were reported (P values < 0.1).

In a network analysis using BioLayout Express3D [38],
we identified the distinct functional clusters of microbial
genes for each experiment and the combination of the
three experiments. These networks consist of nodes repre-
senting microbial genes and the connecting edges deter-
mining the correlations in abundance and functional
linkages between these genes.

We used partial least squares (PLS) analysis (Version 9.1

tify the most important genes associated with the Proteo-
bacteria:(Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes)
ratio. The PLS
analysis accounts for multiple testing and the correlation
between microbial genes. In addition to microbial genes,
the model included the effects of diet (potentially stressor)
and breed type (host genetics effect). The model

were based on the variable importance for projection

Two hundred and four genes associated with resistance,

(Additional file 1: Figure S1). The total number of se-

in
rumen samples
from concentrate-fed compared to
forage-fed cattle (Additional file 1: Figure S2A), and di-
versity was
in concentrate-fed steers
(Additional file 1: Figure S2B). Biofilm formation and
antibiotic resistance genes, representing 46.76% of the
204 genes, were the dominant groups detected. Other

Differences in gene composition observed between rumen
samples and their clustering due to diets were confirmed
by PCoA that explained 68.6% over the first two axes
(Fig. 1a). After grouping the samples, CVA confirmed that
diet was the only factor that was significantly correlated
(no overlapping within the 95% circles of confidence) with
the functional gene composition and explaining this

ence (Fig. 1b). Host breed effect and Proteobacteria ratio
were not significantly correlated with functional gene
composition (Additional file 1: Figure S3).

The abundance of 50 genes, each representing at least
0.001% of total genes per sample, was identified as dif-
ferent between diets (P < 0.05; Fig. 2). A greater number
of genes (n = 32) were more abundant in samples from
animals offered the concentrate diet (n = 18). Opposite
results were observed between genes with similar

tion like AMR genes (Fig. 3). For example, genes associ-
ated with resistance to macrolide (K08217) and β-
lactamase (K01467, K07576) were significantly more
abundant in samples from animals offered the concen-
trate diet (P < 0.001), whilst the sum of genes including
chloramphenicol

(K00638) and microcin resistance were dominant
in
forage-fed samples (P < 0.001; Fig. 3). Finally, genes en-

treatment samples (P < 0.01; Figs. 2 and 3). In general,
similar results were confirmed when using the more spe-

Of
the 24 most abundant archaeal and bacterial
phyla, 12 phyla including Proteobacteria were more
abundant in animals offered the concentrate diet (P <
0.1; Fig. 4 and Additional file 1: Figure S5). In con-
trast, Euryarchaeota, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacteres
and Verrucomicrobia were more abundant in rumen
samples from animals offered a forage diet (P < 0.01).
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and 14 other phyla were

not
significantly affected by diet. A Proteobacteria ratio
above 0.19, suggesting dysbiosis, was only detected in
rumen samples from the concentrate diet treatment,
and thus, this ratio was on average higher for rumen
samples from animals offered the concentrate than
the forage diet (P = 0.001; Fig. 5). In addition, this ra-
tio was strongly correlated with diet change (P =
0.001), but not with other factors tested except me-

In

Discussion
In the present study, the results of three independent ex-
periments were combined. This meta-analysis was used
to highlight the importance of diet rather than the host
on the structure of rumen microbial genes associated
with resistance, colonisation, communication and patho-
genicity activities. It is known that diet
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
has a dominant
effect on the microbial community composition [40, 41],
and here, we first identified that diet influences func-
tional genes associated with AMR and more interest-
ingly microbial genes (e.g. genes encoding for cold shock
protein, T6SS, motility, hooking and sensing) allowing
the microbial populations to adapt to the new ruminal
environment generated by concentrate diet. Information

on the composition of the initial rumen microbiome
may provide further information, but was not

Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
available
for this study. However, all animals were offered the
same forage-based diet prior to the trial and animals
were randomly allocated to diets (balanced for breed) at
the start of each experiment. Consequently, there is no
reason to believe that the prevalence of antibiotic resist-
ance genes differed at the start of each experiment.
Therefore, we are confident in our results that concen-
trate diet significantly increased the relative abundance
and diversity of AMR genes and other

genes studied in
this manuscript.

mecha-
nisms [43–45]. T6SS which is more prevalent in Proteo-
bacteria helps in colonising the gut [46] and controlling
bacterial growth in a disturbed rumen [47]. Moreover, mi-
croorganisms carrying genes encoding flagellin, which are
enhanced when a high-concentrate diet is fed, are known
to develop strategies to evade innate immune system de-
tection [48, 49] and therefore increase the risk of disease.
Another host-microbiome interaction system involves fu-
cose sensing, and one gene
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
encoding for alpha-L-
fucosidase was significantly enriched in concentrate-fed
animals. This gene may enhance the abundance of com-
mensals and also pathogenic bacteria carrying this gene
and increase the risk of infection [22]. Finally, it is known
that competition between host and pathogens occurs for
iron resources. Genes associated with iron storage (fer-
ritin) or transport were differently affected depending of
the diet and tend to suggest a lower iron availability for
microorganisms
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
including pathogens in concentrate com-
pared to forage-fed animals. It is known that iron serves
as a signal for bacterial pathogens to recognise host cells

in an iron-depleted environment, potentially leading to
disease [50].

Henderson et al. [10] found similar results, demonstrat-
ing the predominant influence of diet over the host effect
and explaining the differences in microbial community
composition. The host effect was identified in the present
study as a breed effect, which has been
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
shown in our pre-
vious study to be of substantially less impact on the
microbiome, than within-breed genetic effects.

In addition,

(higher evenness)

feeding the concentrate diet signifi-
cantly enhanced the diversity of these rumen micro-
bial genes
including a broader
spectrum of mechanisms of resistance compared to
the forage diet. The increase in abundance and diver-
sity of AMR and pathogenicity genes in rumen sam-
ples from concentrate-fed animals could also be the
result of
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
multi-resistant bacteria enrichment [51], or
an increase in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as a re-
sult of gut dysbiosis [52, 53] or rumen colonisation
[54]. Therefore, the risk of spreading antimicrobial re-
sistance genes between microbial populations belong-
ing to the same or a different phylum and including
human pathogens increases [55].

Microbial genes significantly abundant in rumen samples
from animal offered the forage diet
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
were mainly associated
with activities known to be involved in beneficial host-
microbiome interaction and its homeostasis involving non-
pathogenic bacteria. For example, antimicrobial peptides
like microcin are produced and released by gut epithelial
cells and help to maintain the host-microbiome homeosta-
sis [56]. Homeostasis helps to reduce pathogen colonisation
[57] without causing collateral damage to host cells [49,
53]. Therefore,
it is coherent to find more microcin-
resistance genes
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
mostly identified in commensal bacteria
[58] and also carrying microcin synthesis genes providing a
competitive advantage against enteric pathogens [57] when
feeding a high-forage diet, which is known to promote
rumen homeostasis [59]. This system is less aggressive and
energy demanding than other systems like T6SS used by,
e.g. pathogenic Proteobacteria [45]. Forage diets, which
contain more fibre, are recognised to enhance gut health in
different animal species by modulating the gut

Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
microbiome,
its impact on the host mucosa and reducing the level of
stress or disease compared to grain-fed animals [59, 60].

The results obtained with the concentrate diet can be ex-
plained by the necessity for the rumen microbiome to adapt
to a new environment [61] and the increase in populations
with broader adaptability and colonisation capacities. Inter-
the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, one
estingly,
phylum containing bacterial populations associated with
AMR and pathogenicity
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
[27], was one of the bacterial phyla
enriched when feeding the concentrate diet. We also identi-
fied bacterial genera within Proteobacteria (e.g. Tolumonas
or Methylomonas) and including pathogens (e.g. Aeromo-
nas or Moraxella) with a relative abundance above 0.001%
and strongly correlated with the Proteobacteria ratio which
may explain the high Proteobacteria ratio detected in 8
rumen samples from animal offered the concentrate diet.
Interestingly, the plant pathogen Pantoea, belonging to
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
Pro-
teobacteria, was also significantly more abundant when
feeding the concentrate diet and highly correlated with the
Proteobacteria ratio, suggesting that microorganisms colo-
nising plants and present in the diet might play a role in
the rumen. Functional similarities between microorganisms
inhabiting the gut or plant roots and sharing similar eco-
logical niches were found, supporting a potential role of
these plant-associated microbial populations during the
acidotic challenge
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
[62].

Proteobacteria populations partly explained the change
in functional gene composition and diversity observed in
samples from animals offered the concentrate diet. A
high Proteobacteria ratio was also significantly negatively
correlated with a low acetate to propionate ratio (a
proxy for low ruminal pH) [12]. It is known that concen-
trate diets with a high grain content tend to increase
propionate concentration and are associated with lower
rumen pH, as well as an increase in the
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
abundance of

Proteobacteria [12]. The formulation of concentrate di-
ets with respect to the proportion of starch to digestible
fibre could be more important than the concentrate type
for explaining the effect on rumen pH [63], and this in-
formation could be used as a strategy to reduce the det-
rimental effect of concentrate diet
increasing the
abundance and diversity of the genes targeted in this
study.

We confirmed the relevance of using a Proteobacteria
ratio instead of Proteobacteria
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
abundance as a proxy of a
microbiome dysbiosis and more pathogenic bacteria may
increase the risk of host disease [12, 14]. This ratio was
significantly correlated with a gene encoding for a cold
shock protein known to have a wider role in bacterial
stress tolerance and reinforcing the detrimental effect of
the concentrate diet on the rumen microbiome [2].

Finally, the 43 rumen microbial genes identified by
PLS analysis to be significantly associated with the Pro-
teobacteria ratio include
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
several AMR genes such as
genes encoding for beta-lactamase. Although these genes
were distributed over several clusters, most of them were
grouped in one major cluster as shown by the network
analysis. Therefore,
it would be possible to apply the
same strategy as Roehe et al. [26] to determine a base-
line of these genes for risk assessment.

Conclusions
In conclusion, diets with high fibrous forage components
would be recommended over those with high grain com-
ponents to lower the abundance
----
Source: 40168_2017_Article_378.pdf
and diversity of AMR
genes and to avoid rumen microbiome dysbiosis associ-
ated with pathogenic species among ruminal Proteobac-
teria. The results presented here will help to improve
policies about antimicrobial treatments in beef cattle
production and to help avoid AMR gene transmission to
bovine-associated human pathogens. We describe AMR
gene abundance/diversity in antibiotic-free cattle that
complements published information on AMR genes in
animals receiving antimicrobials. It will now be

import-
ant to combine the investigation of AMR usage with
dietary regime, to determine whether alterations in diet
can lessen the threats associated with AMR in livestock
production.

obtaining

60 countries. We ﬁnd systematic differences in abundance and diversity of AMR genes

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a cross-cutting and

increasing threat to global health1,2, and it threatens

to
undermine decades of progress in the treatment of
infectious diseases. AMR is a complex problem with multiple and
interconnected drivers, which may include changing dynamics in
travel, trade, climate change, and populations. Reliable informa-
the global
tion that accurately describes and characterizes
occurrence and transmission of AMR is essential to address this
challenge and to support national and global priority setting,
public health actions, and treatment decisions.

Current
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
surveillance of AMR is often focusing on a few
pathogens only and mainly based on passive reporting of phe-
notypic laboratory results for speciﬁc pathogens isolated from
human clinical infections1,3–5. This procedure leads to signiﬁcant
time delays, often incomparable data, and a narrow pathogen
spectrum not capturing all relevant AMR genes, where the major
part might be present in the commensal bacterial ﬂora of healthy
individuals. However, obtaining fecal samples from healthy
humans is
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
logistically difﬁcult.

From a surveillance point of view, urban sewage is attractive
because it provides sampling material from a large and mostly
healthy population, which otherwise would not be feasible to
monitor. Globally, a rapidly increased proportion of the human
population live in urban areas6 and an increasing proportion
is connected to a sewer system7,8. In addition, analyzing sewage
samples does not require informed consent,

Moreover,

and the data can be reanalyzed if novel genes of interest are
identiﬁed. It should, however, also be acknowledged that short-

regarding the host of the genes or the genetic environment.
Metagenomics has been found to be superior to conventional

for AMR surveillance in pig herds13 and has also been
utilized for the surveillance of global AMR gene dissemination
through international ﬂights14. Additionally, an extensively
shared resistome was observed across urban sewage samples
within China15, as well as between individuals and environ-
mental samples in Lima, Peru16. Interestingly, Pehrsson et al.16
showed that even though changes in the bacterial composition
were observed between feces and sewage, this was not the case
for AMR

Here we use metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to
characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in 60 coun-
tries. We ﬁnd systematic differences in abundance and diversity
of AMR genes between Europe/North-America/Oceania and
Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial use data and bac-
terial taxonomy only explain a minor part of the AMR variation
that we observe. However, AMR gene abundance strongly
correlates with socio-economic, health, and environmental
factors, which we

use to predict AMR gene abundances in all
countries in the world. Our ﬁndings suggest that global AMR
gene diversity and abundance vary by region and that
improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the
global burden of AMR.

Results
Global distribution of AMR genes. Domestic sewage was col-
lected from 79 sample locations, covering 7 geographical regions
from 74 cities in 60 countries (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1).
Each sample was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq and the
resulting

Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
data (>1.4 Tb) processed using MGmapper17. The
average number of reads per sample was 120 million reads (range:
8 million –398 million). An average of 0.03% of the reads were
assigned to AMR genes, while on average 29%, 1%, 0.4%, and
0.2% were assigned to bacterial, protozoa, plants, and human
genomic material, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Sixty-
eight percent of the reads could not be assigned to any reference
sequence, and other metagenomic studies have also found larger
number of
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
un-mapped reads (42%–48%)14,18. Rarefaction of the
reads mapping to bacterial genomes showed a tendency toward
saturation in the sequence data (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Analyses of duplicate samples from separate days from eight
sites
showed a high degree of within-site reproducibility
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Comparison of the data from the same

A total of 1546 genera were detected across all samples (range:
942–1367 genera per sample), but a limited number of bacterial
genera dominated (Supplementary Data 3, Supplementary Fig. 4).
Several of the dominant bacterial genera were typical fecal, such
as Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and
Biﬁdobacterium. However, other
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
highly abundant bacterial
genera, such as Acidovorax and Acinetobacter, are most likely
environmental bacteria. Thus,
the bacterial composition of
sewage is complex and does not only reﬂect human feces but
also the changes occurring in the sewer. A comparison with
publicly available metagenomic data, although generated using
different DNA-puriﬁcation methods, suggested that our urban
sewage samples resemble more the human fecal microbiome than
the animal
fecal microbiome from chickens, pigs, or

(Supplementary Fig. 5).

The total AMR gene abundances varied across sites and
continents (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 4). The highest AMR
gene levels were observed in African countries (average: 2034.3
fragments per kilo base per million fragments (FPKM)), although
Brazil had the highest abundance of all (4616.9 FPKM). At the
lower end of the spectrum were Oceania (New Zealand and
Australia) (average: 529.5 FPKM). To the best of our knowledge,
comparable data on the global occurrence of

Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
AMR genes of
predominantly healthy people do not exist. In agreement with our
ﬁndings, a previous study on the resistome from toilet waste from
long-distance ﬂights14 suggested that the AMR levels in South
Asia were higher than in Europe. Data on AMR in bacteria
isolated from clinical
infections in humans, collected by the
World Health Organization (WHO)1, suggest a high prevalence
of AMR in many developing countries, even though several of the
national studies reported by the WHO give

Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
contradictory results1.
A total of 1625 different AMR genes belonging to 408 gene
groups were identiﬁed,
that have emerged
including several
recently, such as CTX-M, NDM, mcr, and optrA (Supplementary
Data 4). Several different AMR genes might encode resistance to the
same antimicrobial agent. Thus the relative abundance of AMR
genes was aggregated to the corresponding antimicrobial class level
for each sample to explore major trends across countries (Fig. 1c).
AMR genes encoding resistance

Each sample is represented by a dot with horizontal jitter
for visibility. The horizontal box lines represent the ﬁrst quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Whiskers denote the range of points within the ﬁrst
quartile − 1.5× the interquartile range and the third quartile + 1.5× the interquartile range. c Relative AMR abundance per antimicrobial class (AmGlyc

resistance to sulfonamides and phenicols. Fifteen AMR genes
contributed >50% of the total AMR abundance (Fig. 1d). This
proportion was especially prominent for Europe, North-America,
and Oceania. None of the dominant AMR genes are known to be
restricted to speciﬁc bacterial genera19–21.

Europe/North-America/Oceania and samples from Africa/Asia/
South-America. Regional groupings explained 27% of the dis-
similarity between sample resistomes
(adonis2, p < 0.001;
Fig. 2a). The separation among the groups was mainly driven
by higher levels of resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycosides,
beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim in the Africa/
Asia/South America cluster, whereas

macrolide resistance was
more evenly distributed among all samples (Fig. 2b). A clearer
clustering was observed based on regions, compared with
clustering based on diet, income, or the Human Development
Index (HDI) (Supplementary Figs. 6–7). A stronger regional
separation was observed on the AMR class level, compared with
the gene level (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6). On the class level,
a very clear separation of all samples in two groups was
observed, where only a single European sample
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
(Malta) did not
cluster with all other samples from Europe/North America/
Oceania (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, only one sample from Asia
(Kazakhstan), one from the Middle East (Turkey), and one
from South America (Galapagos Islands) clustered with the
Europe/North-America/Oceania group.

Several alpha diversity indices for each sample resistome were
calculated (Supplementary Fig. 8). The
resistome median
evenness was higher in African and Asian countries compared
with resistomes from other
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
geographical locations. Thus not only
do these regions have a higher prevalence of AMR genes, but also
a more equal distribution of the different AMR genes.

Analyses of the alpha diversity of the bacterial taxonomic
composition showed less separation according to geographical
regions compared with the AMR genes (Supplementary Figs. 9–
11), and regions explained less of the variation in the resistome
(adonis2, 27%)
composition
(adonis2, 17%). To test the degree to which bacterial genus-
level

composition of
the microbiota is associated with the
resistomes, Procrustes analyses were performed (Supplementary
Fig. 12). We compared ordinations of the bacterial taxonomic
composition with the resistome and found that they correlated
signiﬁcantly (protest, p < 0.001).

compared with the bacterial

AMR genes and drug use association. Several studies have
shown that antimicrobial use (AMU) selects for AMR22,23 and
that reducing AMU often results in reduced AMR24,25, except
when there is
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
interference between genetically linked AMR genes
conferring resistance to different antimicrobial classes26. It has
also been suggested that AMU explains only some of
the
variation22,23 and that other factors such as diet, cultural tradi-
tions and occupation also have an inﬂuence22,27.

In this study, the association between AMU and the occurrence
of AMR in the sewage samples was estimated using a generalized
linear mixed-effects model, with the counts of genes in the

2015 data from Europe [www.ecdc.dk] and IQVIA, formerly
Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. (see Methods). In the regression
model, we accounted for the potential effects
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
of cross-resistance
by ﬁtting ﬁxed effects of both usage of the antimicrobial class that
a resistance gene primarily confers resistance to (direct selection
for resistance) and the total AMU (indirect selection via cross-
resistance). While our model showed a signiﬁcant increase in the
abundance of AMR genes belonging to a speciﬁc antimicrobial
class with increasing usage of that antimicrobial class, we found
no signiﬁcant effect of
total usage of all antimicrobials on
abundance of the
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
different classes (Supplementary Fig. 13A,
Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that, while AMU of a
speciﬁc class is an important driver of AMR genes encoding
resistance to that class, the effects of cross- and/or co-resistance
appear
to have a relatively minor contribution to AMR
abundances. Furthermore, our model showed that the countries
with a lower HDI (i.e., higher in rank) have lower abundances of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.01) and that the number of passengers
arriving in a country via
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
ﬂights has no effect on the abundance of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.62).

A second (similar) model was developed to test the association
between the abundance of AMR genes on the antimicrobial class
level and the antimicrobial residue levels. Again we accounted for
the potential effects of cross-resistance by ﬁtting ﬁxed effects of
both residues of the antimicrobial class that a resistance gene
primarily confers resistance to (direct selection for resistance) and
the total antimicrobial residue
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
levels (indirect selection via cross-
resistance). As before, this model showed a signiﬁcant increase in
the abundance of AMR genes belonging to a speciﬁc antimicro-
bial class with increasing levels of drug residues of
that
antimicrobial class; however, we found no signiﬁcant effect of
total residue levels (Supplementary Fig. 13B). As with the
previous model, this model also showed that the countries with
a lower HDI (i.e., higher in rank) were less abundant in terms of
AMR genes (glmm, p <
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
0.001), and that the number of passengers
arriving in a country via ﬂights had no effect on the abundance of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.746), indicating that the results are
robust.

Of interest is that there was no correlation between AMU and
antimicrobial residue in our data (lm, R2 = 0.00098, p = 0.55).
One possible explanation for this could be that AMR abundances
accumulates on a long timescale because of the average usage in a
country (i.e., (long term) AMU impacts the level of
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
resistance);
however, on a much shorter timescale ﬂuctuations in AMU will
change the AMR composition (diversity) somewhat, which is
captured by the residue levels, which can be interpreted as a
(short) temporal snapshot of the actual usage.

Prediction of AMR based on population-level health data. We
observed that AMU only explained a minor part of the occur-
rence of AMR across the world. In addition, AMU data are dif-
ﬁcult to obtain and likely subject to limitations due to the lack of
an
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
effective prescription system in many countries. Measuring
antimicrobial residue levels in sewage as a proxy for AMU is also
associated with uncertainties and the rapid degradation in the
environment of the heavily used beta-lactamase-sensitive anti-
microbials makes it difﬁcult to reliably measure them.

Because the HDI was strongly associated with AMR, in the
results of our model, we hypothesized that a number of other
factors could be either drivers or indicators for AMR. To
investigate this
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
further, we used 1503 variables from the World
Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population as well as Development
indicator data sets collected between the years 2000 and 2016 for
259 countries and territories to study the potential association
with the observed AMR gene abundances. Using country-speciﬁc

variables, we were able to explain up to 89% of the observed
variation across the samples (Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplemen-
tary Table 2). Most of the variables associated with AMR levels
were
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
related to sanitation and general health (Fig. 3, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 15, Supplementary Table 3). Subsequently, the identiﬁed
variables were used to predict the occurrence of AMR in 259
countries and territories. The three countries predicted to have
the lowest level of AMR were The Netherlands, New Zealand, and
Sweden, whereas the highest predicted AMR levels were for
Tanzania, Vietnam, and Nigeria (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 5).
The predicted global country-level resistance levels were
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
multi-
plied with the latest national population estimate and used to
create global maps of healthy human-associated AMR (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16).

Discussion
A reliable base of evidence that accurately describes and char-
acterizes the global burden and transmission of AMR is essential
to support national and global priority setting, public health
actions, and treatment decisions. Compared to samples directly
obtained from humans, a major advantage of sewage is that such
samples can be easily
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
obtained and analyzed without ethical
concerns. Thus, while current efforts to improve surveillance of
AMR in human clinical pathogens should be continued1,3–5, we
do suggest that our study provides the foundation for a ﬂexible,
simple, affordable, and ethically acceptable global real-time sur-
veillance of AMR that could be immediately implemented glob-
ally also in low- and middle-income countries. The study design
can furthermore be used for other infectious disease agents.

Our study
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
represents, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst
attempt to monitor and predict the occurrence of AMR in the
global predominantly healthy human population. Even though
the study suffers from the limitation that only a single sample was
analyzed from each site, our study suggests a strong systematic
separation of regions of the world according to AMR gene
abundance with high-income countries in Europe/North-Amer-
ica/Oceania constituting one cluster and low-income countries
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
in
Africa/Asia/South-America constituting another cluster. This
separation was mainly driven by a relatively high abundance of a
limited number of AMR genes encoding macrolide resistance
genes in Europe/North-America/Oceania, compared with a gen-
eral high abundance of several different AMR genes from dif-
ferent classes in the rest of the world. The countries standing out
as having the most divergent distribution of AMR genes were
Vietnam, India, and Brazil, suggesting that these countries
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
could
be hot spots for emergence of novel AMR mechanisms.

In this study, we used metagenomics that beneﬁt from the
ability to quantify thousands of genes simultaneously and that the
data can be reanalyzed if novel genes of interest are identiﬁed.
However, other methodologies might also be useful such as cul-
ture and PCR-based methods that might have better sensitivity.
Comparative studies evaluating the usefulness of various tech-
including evaluation of sensitivity, speciﬁcity,
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
and
nologies,
number of targets detected, are warranted.

In our study, we have focused on total AMR abundance.
However, the resistance to the different antimicrobial classes are
not equally important28 neither are all AMR genes29. Thus fur-
ther studies could also beneﬁt from addressing speciﬁc resistance
genes.

An analysis of the same IQVIA AMU data from 2000 to
2015, as we have used here, was recently published30, and even
though a signiﬁcant increase in AMU was observed, especially
for
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
countries in Africa, Asia, and South-America, the quantities
are still below most countries in Europe and North-America.

treatment plant or from the main outlet to rivers or similar according to the
protocol provided. Flow proportion sampling over 24 h was preferred.
Alternatively, three crude point samples were collected in a short time interval, i.e.,
at least 5 min between each individual sample, to ensure as much randomness as
possible. The collected urban sewage was not treated, neither with additives nor
DNA stabilizers and was recommended to be stored

Sample handling and DNA extraction. At DTU Food, a photograph of each
sample container was taken upon arrival combined with a short remark describing
the condition of the sample, e.g., solid frozen, thawed, coloration, etc. The samples
of the ﬁrst of the consecutive days were

Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
thawed for 12 h at approximately 20 °C
before processing. After thawing, 250 mL of each sample were pelleted in a cen-
trifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was stored at −20 °C or −80 °C before
DNA extraction and metagenomics analysis, and the supernatant was stored at
−80 °C for subsequent antimicrobial residue and virus analysis. DNA was extracted
from the sewage pellets according to an optimized protocol using the QIAamp Fast
DNA Stool Mini Kit including twice the input material and

For each batch of DNA extractions, a DNA extraction blank control was processed
in parallel with the sewage samples to monitor background DNA.

Whole-community sequencing. DNA was shipped on dry ice for library pre-
paration and sequencing to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF).
DNA from all samples was mechanically sheared to a targeted fragment size of 300
bp using ultrasonication (Covaris E220evolution). Library preparation was per-
formed with the
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
NEXTﬂex PCR-free Library Preparation Kit (Bioo Scientiﬁc). The
Bioo NEXTﬂex-96 adapter set (Bioo Scientiﬁc) was used, and in batches of roughly
60 samples, the libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on the HiSeq3000
platform (Illumina), using 2 × 150-bp paired-end sequencing per ﬂow cell. The raw
sequencing data have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under
accession number ERP015409.

Trimming and mapping of sequencing reads. The reads were trimmed, including
adaptor removal,
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
using BBduk [BBMap—Bushnell B.—https://sourceforge.net/
projects/bbmap/] with a quality threshold at 20 and minimum length of 50 bp.
Trimmed reads were used as input to the reference-based mapping and taxonomy-
assignment tool MGmapper17, which is based on BWA-MEM33 version 0.7.12 and
SAMtools34 version 1.6. Reads were aligned against reference sequence databases
for the best hit (Bestmode, i.e., a read can only map to 1 reference sequence). An
acquired AMR gene database (ResFinder)35 was used
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
to annotate properly paired
reads (MGmapper option fullmode) where each read pair had sequence coverage of
at least 80% compared with the length of the trimmed reads. This was the only
ﬁlter that was applied to discard a read pair. The AMR genes were of bacterial
origin and could therefore align to both bacteria databases and the Resﬁnder
database. To enable multiple database hits, AMR genes were mapped using the
Fullmode option in MGmapper for the most optimal abundance calculation.
Genomic
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
annotation was performed by identifying the best hit (MGmapper option
bestmode) for a pair of reads when aligned against a range of reference sequence
databases. Databases were primarily downloaded via NCBI genbank clade speciﬁc
assembly_summary.txt ﬁles unless another ftp site is provided below. The list of
databases used by MGmapper includes: Human (GRCh38.p3), bacteria (closed
genomes), MetaHitAssembly (PRJEB674—PRJEB1046), HumanMicrobiome
(genomes assemblies), bacteria_draft, plasmid,
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
archaea, virus, fungi, protozoa,
vertebrates_mammals, vertebrates_other, invertebrates, plant, and nt. For the
bacteria and bacteria_draft databases, sequences were selected from the assem-
bly_summary.txt ﬁle, when annotated with the tags version_status=‘latest’ and
genome_rep=‘Full’. Furthermore, assembly_level= ‘Complete genome’ or ‘Chro-
mosome’ were required for entries in the bacteria database and refseq_categor-
y=‘representative genome’ for entries in the bacteria_draft database. The
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
plasmid
database was constructed as the subset of bacteria and bacteria_draft sequences
having the word ‘plasmid’ in the fasta entry header line.

The total bacteria read count for a sample was calculated as the sum of read

counts from each of the bacteria-related databases (bacteria, bacteria_draft,
MetaHitAssembly, and HumanMicrobiome). The total fraction of unmapped reads
for all sample sites were used to translate the percentage of unmapped reads into Z-
scores, i.e., the number of
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
standard deviations from the mean. Setting an absolute
Z-score threshold at 3 retained data from 79 sample sites. Data from Chad were
excluded based on the Z-score threshold together with data from Gambia with
suspiciously low resistance read counts; i.e., lower than those observed from DNA
extraction control samples.

Bacterial and AMR gene distribution. Inspection of the count tables and the
mapped reads distribution on the genomes revealed an overestimation of some
genomes due to plasmids
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
with high copy numbers. The issue only occurred in the
included draft genomes, as the plasmid DNA were left out of the database with
complete bacterial genomes. The distribution of mapped reads across contigs was
expected to be evenly distributed, with some variation. The plasmids were revealed
by large hit counts to speciﬁc contigs compared with the associated contigs in a
draft genome. For each draft genome, the hits to each contig was normalized with
respect to contig size. The median of the
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
contig hits was found and the third
quartile and the interquartile range was calculated. If a hit count was above the
third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, then the hit count was inter-
preted as an overestimation and adjusted by replacing the hit count with the
median.

Relative abundance of AMR genes and bacterial genera were calculated as

FPKM. This was done to account for both sample-wise sequencing depth
differences and size-dependent probability of observing a reference.
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
For bacterial
genome assemblies, FPKM was calculated based on the adjusted sum of fragments
assigned to a genome assembly, whether or not the genome was closed. For AMR
genes, FPKM was calculated on each individual ResFinder reference sequence.
FPKMs were subsequently summed up across categories to bacterial genera (NCBI
taxid), drug class level (NCBI tax ID), and highly homologous AMR gene groups
(CD-HIT-EST, 90% similarity)36.

(BC) dissimilarities and hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. 2). The replicated
samples were

Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
taken by 2 days apart. The day 2 samples were taken twice. The day
2 samples were kept in freezer for 2 years prior sequencing. Samples from day 1 and
day 2 were sequenced using the same DNA extraction and sequencing protocols. The
replicated samples had higher resistome similarity to its own replicates and all eight
sets of replicate samples were clustered with their own replicate. This result shows a
strong reproducibility of sewage samples despite having different day of sampling and
2 years

Within-country representativeness. To assess whether samples from individual
sites are representative of other sites in that country, we compared the BC dis-
similarities for pairs of sites within the same country and in different countries for
both resistome and bacteriome compositions. We assessed the signiﬁcance of these
differences using permutation tests. We permuted the country labels for each
sample and reassessed the
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
dissimilarities for pairs of sites within the same country
and in different countries with permuted labels. We repeated this procedure 106
times to build up a null distribution of the differences in dissimilarity within and
among countries. We found that resistome dissimilarities were on average 34%
higher for pairs of sites in different countries than for pairs of sites within the same
country (permutation, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 3A and B), while bacteriome
dissimilarities were 46%
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
higher for pairs of sites in different countries than for pairs
of sites within the same country (p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 3C and D). These
results show that there is less variance across sites within countries than across sites
within different countries. Thus individual sites in this study are representative of
other sites in that country.

The quality of the data was assessed and if necessary adapters were removed and
trimmed with a quality threshold at 20 and minimum length of 50 bp. All pairwise
Jaccard distances of the aforementioned metagenomes, all global sewage samples,
and the control samples were calculated with Mash37. The heat map was drawn in
R 3.4.4 (pheatmap).

Sample dissimilarities. Matrices with

relative abundances (FPKM) of AMR genes
and bacterial genera were Hellinger-transformed using the decostand function in

tion, also in vegan (Supplementary Data 6).

Heat maps. The relative abundances (FPKM) of AMR genes were log-transformed
and visualized in a heat map (pheatmap), showing the 50 most abundant genes.
The gene-wise dendrogram is based on Pearson product moment correlation
coefﬁcients (PPMC), while

the sample dendrogram is based on the aforementioned
BC dissimilarity matrices, not just for the visualized genes, but all genes. Both
dendrograms are the result of complete linkage clustering. The bacterial genera
heat map was produced in the same way, while the AMR class-level heat map
differs by using PPMC for hierarchical clustering of both AMR classes and samples.
Continent association was included as metadata for all heat maps. For the AMR
genes, we included World Bank income levels

Sample ordination. Dissimilarity matrices were subject to classical multi-
dimensional scaling (PCoA) to obtain the ﬁrst two principal coordinates as well as
the variance explained by each, ignoring negative eigenvectors. This was done using
the cmdscale command in R.

Testing of sample dissimilarities. The BC dissimilarity

matrices used for PCoA
were also used for permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis2 func-
tion in vegan). The geographical group assigned to each sample was used as a
predictor for dissimilarity.

Alpha diversity. Diversity and richness were calculated on rariﬁed versions of the
resistance and bacterial count matrices. For resistance genes, the two samples with
<1000 read pairs were excluded. Subsequently, count matrices were subsampled to
the lowest samples’ depth, using the

index (1-D), Pielou’s evenness, and the Chao1 richness estimates were calculated
using the diversity function in the vegan package.

Procrustes analysis. The vegan package was used for comparing the resistome
dissimilarities with the bacteriome dissimilarities. The protest function was used to
scale and rotate the principal coordinates of the bacterial PCoA onto the principal
coordinates of the resistome PCoA and testing the strength of the

Correlation between AMU and external explanatory variables. A multilevel
Poisson model was developed to investigate the sources of variance for the
abundance of AMR genes and the relationship between AMU and abundance of
AMR genes found in the samples. The counts of the individual AMR genes in each
of the samples (see “Collection of urban sewage samples” and
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
“Whole-community
sequencing“ sections) aggregated at the antimicrobial class level was used as the
dependent variable.

An observation-level random effect was used to model the over dispersion
inherent to count data41. Because several samples were sequenced more than once
on separate sequencing runs, we were able to estimate and correct for the noise in
mean AMR gene abundance owing to the sampling process. Therefore, a
categorical variable indicating which sample was used was included as a
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
random
effect (sample). A categorical variable identifying each location to allow for the
estimation of variation in abundance of resistance genes between the different
sampling locations (location) was included. Furthermore, a variable identifying the
resistance class a resistance gene is a member of was included to estimate the
variance due to differences in abundance between antimicrobial classes (class).

For the ﬁxed effects, we included a measure of AMU at the country level. Data
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
from

the ECDC database (Supplementary Data 1) and data from the IMS database
(Supplementary Data 1) were used to calculate a new variable from the two data sets. To
this end, we used the data from the ECDC data set where available to predict missing
values from the IMS data set by using a linear regression model. Because the data from
the two data sets are highly correlated (r = 0.97, p < 0.01, Pearson’s product moment
correlation), we could infer the (approximate) corresponding ECDC value
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
from the
IMS value for that particular country. The antimicrobial usage data were then log-
transformed. Because it has been argued that many antimicrobial classes show cross-
resistance, where resistance to one antimicrobial class also confers resistance to another
class, we accounted for the potential effects of cross-resistance by ﬁtting effects of both
usage of the antimicrobial class that a resistance gene primarily confers resistance to
(direct selection for resistance) and total AMU
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
(indirect selection via cross-resistance).
We also included the total number of passengers arriving in a country in 2015 as a ﬁxed
effect in the model. Data on the number of passengers were extracted from the ICAO
international ﬂight database [https://portal.icao.int, downloaded April 2016] and log-
transformed. Lastly, we included the United Nations HDI as a ﬁxed effect. HDI data
from 2015 were extracted for the United Nations Development Programme website39
and log-transformed and scaled

before including them in the ﬁnal model. The same
model set-up was used to investigate the association between drug residue levels and
AMR gene abundance. In this model, data on the drug residues in the samples was
included as a ﬁxed effect instead of the AMU data. All other effects (random and ﬁxed)
were kept the same. Others models including temperature at the collection site at the
day of sampling and Gross Domestic Product showed no signiﬁcant association with
AMR genes abundance (glmm’s,

Resistance prediction. World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population as well as
Development indicator data sets collected between the years 2000 and 2016 for 259
countries and territories were downloaded from http://databank.worldbank.org/
data/home.aspx in October 2017 and used to formulate AMR predictive models.
Imputations of missing data were conducted using the missForest R package, which
is a random forest-based technique that is highly computationally efﬁcient
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
for
high-dimensional data consisting of both categorical and continuous predictors42.
The ﬁnal data set consisted of 1503 economic and health indicator variables
(Supplementary Data 7). The most important variables predicting total resistance
(FPKM) were selected from the World Bank data set and a recursive feature
elimination method from the R library caret (Supplementary Table 3). The model
was also run on all 1503 variables for comparison (Supplementary Table 4) and a
good correlation was
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
observed. The machine learning algorithms Support Vector
Machine and random forest were compared for accuracy in predictions based on
their R2 and Root Mean Square Error43,44. Random forest was the best choice of
model (Supplementary Table 2). Random forest is suitable for data sets with many
features, especially where each of the features contributes little information45. The
prediction model was trained for the 60 countries where resistance data were
available from the current project
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
followed by global predictions of resistance for all
259 countries and territories (Supplementary Data 5).

Overﬁtting remains a major hurdle when applying predictive models especially
involving many predictors. Breiman45 proved that random forest is protected from
overﬁtting by the incorporation of out-of-bag (OOB) estimates and from the law of
large numbers. This followed from earlier proposals on the use of OOB estimates as a
key part of estimation of generalization error46,47. In the study
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
of error estimates for
bagged classiﬁers, Breiman48,49 provided empirical evidence demonstrating same
accuracy from using the OOB estimate as using a test set of the same size as the
training set and further indicated that the use of the OOB error estimate removes the

a set aside test set. OOB is the mean prediction error on each training sample
xi, using only the trees that did not have xi in their bootstrap sample50. During
random forest training, approximately one third of the instances are left out from
each bootstrap training set. This means that the OOB estimates are computed from
only about one third as many classiﬁers as in the ongoing main combination.
However, the error rate decreases as the number of combinations increases, which
means the OOB
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
estimates will tend to overestimate the current error rate. To get
unbiased OOB estimates, random forests are run past the point where the test set
error converges. This has an added advantage that, unlike cross-validation, where bias
is present but its extent unknown, the OOB estimates are unbiased51.

Random forests also aggregate many decision trees to limit overﬁtting as well as

error due to bias because of the law of large numbers. Random forests limit
overﬁtting without substantially

increasing error due to bias due to their ability to
mitigate the problems of high variance and high bias45.

However, a ten-fold cross-validation was included during our model building
by randomly partitioning model input samples into ten sets of roughly equal size
followed by estimation of accuracy based on held-out samples. This held-out
sample was each time returned to the training set and the procedure was repeated
with the second subset held out and so forth. Cross-validation and checking

dards were added. To one of these portions, antimicrobials were added at a level of
25 ng/L for the sulfonamides and 100 ng/L for the tetracyclines, quinolones, and
macrolides. Four mL of EDTA-McIlvain buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0) were added, after
which the samples were shaken for 5 min head-over-head. The residue was

taken
up in 100 μL MeOH, after which 400 μL of water was added. For liquid chroma-
tography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the following gradient was
applied: 0–0.5 min 1% B; 0.5–2.5 min linear increase to 25% B; 2.5–5.4 min linear
increase to 70% B; 5.4–5.5 min linear increase to 100% B, with a ﬁnal hold of 1.0
min. The injection volume was 5 μL. Detection was carried out by an AB Sciex
(Ramingham, MA, USA) Q-Trap 5500 or a Q-Trap 6500 mass spectrometer in

source temperature, 450 °C; GAS 1 and 2, 50 (arbitrary units).

Analysis of aminoglycosides. The analysis of aminoglycosides in the sewage

Twenty mL of extraction liquid (10 mM KH2PO4 with 0.4 mM EDTA and 2%
TCA) were added, and samples were mixed by means of a vortex and shaken head-
over-head for 10 min. The extract was then brought to pH 7.6–7.9 and centrifuged
(15 min, 3600 × g). The complete extract was transferred to a conditioned CBX

Analysis of β-lactams. The analysis of β-lactams in the sewage samples was
performed as in Beredsen et al.54, with adaptations as summarized in the following.
For sample pretreatment, two 10-mL portions of each sample of sewage were
weighed into separate 50-mL tubes, after which internal standards were added. To
one of these portions, β-lactams were added at a level of 50 μg/L
----

for the penicillins
and 500 μg/L for the cephalosporins and carbapenems. Detection was carried out
by a Waters model Xevo TQS or an AB Sciex (Ramingham, MA, USA) Q-Trap
6500 mass spectrometer in positive ESI mode. The parameters used for the QTrap
6500 were: capillary voltage, 2.0 kV; cone voltage, 25 V; source offset, 20 V; source
temperature, 150 °C; desolvation temperature, 550 °C; cone gas ﬂow, 150 L/h; and
desolvation gas, 600 L/h.

Calculation of deﬁned daily dosages (DDDs) based on
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
residues. After con-
sumption, antimicrobials undergo (1) metabolization in the body, (2) are elimi-
nated from the body with urine and/or feces, and might (3) further degrade in the
sewer. A proper calculation of DDD/person/day from concentrations in sewage

therefore requires information on elimination rates and a precise estimate of the
number of persons connected to a sewer and the total water ﬂow at this speciﬁc
location (or the average water consumption per person as surrogate).
----

Here
information on elimination rates and water consumption were not included. In
addition, we can only calculate DDD for human drugs used for systematic infec-
tions. As seen from Supplementary Data 1, the amount of dihysdrostreptomycin is
almost absent, the use of Dapson very low, and the contribution of enroﬂoxacin
and tylosin 0.1% and 0.3% of the residues of quinolones and macrolides, respec-
tively. For the sulfonamides, the excluded drugs constitute 11%.

The concentrations of
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
antimicrobial residues were transformed into DDDs
of antimicrobials for systemic use using the WHO DDD database [www.whocc.
no/atc_ddd_index]. Some residues were excluded as their predominant usage
was not systemic. This was the case for Dapson (main treatment indication:
Lepra treatment), sulfacetamide (main indication: acne), sulfadoxine (main
indication: malaria), sulfathiazole (main indication: topical application, with
varying dosages), enroﬂoxacin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD
----
Source: 41467_2019_Article_8853.pdf
available),
tylosin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD available), and
dihydrostreptomycin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD available). The DDD
were summed over the respective antimicrobial classes. Calculation of the sum
of DDD across classes was not deemed meaningful, because excretion rates
differ largely between antimicrobial classes and also within antimicrobial
classes.

Group antimicrobial administration is used to control disease in livestock, but we have little insight 
into how this impacts antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene dynamics. Here, a longitudinal study was 
carried out during a single

production cycle on a commercial pig unit with high historic and current 
antimicrobial usage. Quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing were used to track faecal AMR gene abundance and diversity and microbiome alpha 
diversity. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified 144 AMR genes in total, with higher AMR gene 
diversity present in young pigs compared to dry sows. Irrespective of in-feed antibiotic treatment or 
changes in microbiome diversity, mean
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
AMR gene copy number was consistently high, with some AMR 
genes present at copy numbers comparable to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. In conclusion, AMR gene 
prevalence and abundance were not influenced by antibiotic use, either during the production cycle or 
following whole-herd medication. The high levels of certain genes indicate they are widely disseminated 
throughout the microbial population, potentially aiding stability. Despite the high and relatively stable 
levels of resistance genes
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
against the main antimicrobials used, these compounds continue to control 
production limiting diseases on this unit.

Antimicrobial agents are used regularly in many agricultural systems worldwide to improve the health, welfare and 
productivity of livestock1,2. This has led to concerns about the anthropogenic selection of antimicrobial-resistant 
bacteria in livestock systems2–4, particularly due to the potential transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
genes from livestock to humans5–7
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
and into the environment8,9. In the United Kingdom, 52% of all antimicro-
bials sold for livestock were used in the pig and poultry sectors, with tetracyclines being reported as the highest 
sold antibiotic class10. Given the substantial use of antimicrobials in pig production, the association between 
antimicrobial use and AMR has been an area of intensive study. Specifically, antimicrobial administration has 
been associated with increased AMR in sentinel bacteria such as Escherichia
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
coli11–13, Staphylococcus aureus14,15, 
and Campylobacter16, Salmonella17 and Enterococcus18 species. Molecular studies have revealed a higher richness 
and diversity of AMR genes in pigs administered oxytetracycline in-feed19, with farm origin being associated 
with AMR gene abundances in faeces at slaughter using both quantitative PCR20 and metagenomic21 datasets. 
However, there are currently few longitudinal studies of AMR in livestock systems, specifically for pig produc-
tion22, with
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
information on antimicrobial use in these systems often derived from national figures, rather than 
from farm medicines records12,21.

Here, we examine microbial population dynamics and both AMR gene abundance and diversity on a single 
pig farm during a six-month production cycle. Faecal samples were collected weekly from a batch of young pigs 
that were followed from birth to slaughter. Group treatments during this time included acidified water, dietary 
zinc supplementation and a prolonged

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
period of in-feed chlortetracycline, followed by tylosin administration. 
Faecal samples from dry sow accommodation containing unmedicated pigs were taken in parallel. Finally, fae-
cal samples were taken from dry sows during and after a partial depopulation event which involved antibiotic 
administration to every pig on the farm to assess if this practice impacted on AMR gene abundance. Microbiome 
alpha diversity, AMR gene abundance and AMR gene diversity were measured by 16S rRNA gene

metabarcoding, 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, respectively.

of pig production cycle, antimicrobial administration and sampling points. Faecal 
sampling (red arrows) was carried out from farrowing pens containing the pregnant sows only (W1), and then 
post-farrowing from both the sow and the nursing pigs during co-housing (W2-W4). Weaners were mixed and 
moved into new accommodation prior to sampling on W5 and were moved to larger accommodation for the 
growing/finishing period prior to sampling on W14. Samples subject to metagenomic sequencing are

(Meta 1 to Meta 3). No sampling was carried out on W6 due to access issues.

Materials and Methods Study farm
In order to study the impact of antimicrobial usage on AMR gene abundance and diversity, a 600 sow Landrace x 
Large White commercial farrowing to finishing unit (United Kingdom) with high historic and current antimicro-
bial usage was recruited. In the three months prior to the study period, a total of 389.1 mg/Population Correction 
Unit (PCU) of antibiotics were used on
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
this farm. This compares to a UK average in pigs of 183 mg/PCU in 2016 
and 131 mg/PCU in 2017, making this a high antibiotic usage farm10. Detailed antimicrobial usage records and 
additional herd information are available in Supplementary Materials 1. This study received ethical approval 
from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies Veterinary Ethics Research Committee. All methods were 
conducted in accordance with institutional and national guidelines and regulations.

Sampling. 
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
Faecal samples were taken from this unit during two time periods (Phase 1 and Phase 2) as 
described below. All samples were collected in universal tubes and stored at −20 °C on-site, prior to batch trans-
portation to the laboratory on dry ice and storage at −80 °C until processing.

Phase 1: Faecal sampling during a single production cycle.  Pooled faecal samples from the pen floors contain-
ing medicated young pigs (referred to as “young pig accommodation”) were collected weekly from just
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
prior to 
farrowing on 26th October 2016 to 5th April 2017 (W1 to W25), when the studied batch were sent for slaughter. 
The sampling design and periods of in-feed medication are summarised in Fig. 1. Weekly faecal samples were 
also taken randomly from the dry sow barn floor (referred to as “dry sow accommodation”) (n = 6) to establish 
background levels of AMR genes in a group of adult pigs that were not routinely medicated with antimicrobials. 
Further medication and sampling details are
----

available in Supplementary Materials 1.

Phase 2: Faecal sampling during and after a partial depopulation. 
In an effort to improve health status and reduce 
antimicrobial use, a partial depopulation was carried out on this farm in May 2017. This involved removing all the 
young pigs (i.e. nursing piglets, weaners, growers and finishers) from the unit, fumigating the young pig accom-
modation with formaldehyde and administering in-feed chlortetracycline and tiamulin to all the breeding sows
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
for a period of six weeks. In order to establish the impact of this management practice on AMR gene abundance 
and diversity, faecal samples were obtained from the dry sow accommodation during the final week of antibiotic 
administration (W36), two months after treatment (W45) and five months after treatment (W57) (n = 6).

Sample preparation and analysis.  DNA extractions and dry matter calculations.  DNA extractions were 
carried out using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen, UK) following the
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
manufacturer’s instructions. In parallel, 
approximately 1 g of homogenised faeces were weighed out and placed into a drying oven overnight at 60 °C. After 
re-weighing, the percentage of dry matter (% DM) was determined.

Quantitative PCR.  Five AMR genes associated with the main antibiotics used on the unit were targeted for 
longitudinal analysis based on initial end point screening of 36 AMR genes. These were tetB and tetQ (tetracy-
cline), ermA and ermB (tylosin) and dfrA1 (trimethoprim).
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
Additionally, quantification of the 16S rRNA gene 
was included as a proxy of overall bacterial load. Plasmids containing gene fragments of tetB, tetQ, ermA, ermB, 
dfrA1 and the 16S rRNA gene were generated in-house and used as standards for absolute quantification of gene

community (20 Strain Even Mix Genomic Material ATCC®MSA-1002, ATCC, United States), the mean sequenc-
ing error rate was calculated as 0.01%.
The generated sequences were processed using cutadapt24 and mothur25 (URL: https://www.mothur.org/wiki/
MiSeq_SOP. Accessed January 2018) as described previously23. Here, unique sequences were binned into opera-
tional taxonomic units (OTUs) using a database-independent approach. A mean of 125,312 sequences per sample 
were retained after

quality control and were subsampled to 10,000 sequences per sample for analysis. Both the 
Inverse Simpson index (ISI) and Shannon index (SI) were calculated for each sample to assess alpha diversity.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing.  Three time points were selected that corresponded to differing antimicrobial 
treatment phases in the young pigs (Fig. 1). Triplicate samples from both the dry sow and young pig accommo-
dation (n = 18) were submitted for shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Edinburgh

Genomics, UK) with further 
details on library preparation and analysis26–34 available in Supplementary Materials 1. The sequence files are 
publicly available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accession number PRJEB34736.

Statistical analysis of alpha diversity and gene abundance data.  Temporal changes in both gene copy number and 
alpha diversity indices were assessed statistically using repeated measures analysis of variance (Genstat 16, VSN 
International, UK) with the
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
data obtained from the dry sow and young pig accommodation faecal samples. To 
assess the impact of the antimicrobial treatments on gene copy number and alpha diversity indices in the young 
pig accommodation, least significant differences were used for multiple comparisons of means.

For the dry sow analyses, the values calculated from samples collected between W1-W25 were included in 
the statistical models. For the young pig analyses, the values calculated from samples collected between
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
W5-W25 
were included in the statistical models, since W1 samples were obtained from pregnant sows only and samples 
obtained between W2-W4 were obtained when the piglets were still grouped by litter and were not yet assigned to 
their rearing pens. For the young pig analyses, the pen was included as a factor to assess any differences between 
the triplicate pen samples.

AMR genes quantified in this study (Table 1). In the dry sow accommodation, high levels of AMR genes were 
detected in the absence of group antimicrobial administration.

Prior to weaning and during co-housing (W1-W4), the levels of all five AMR genes were similar when com-
paring the
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
nursing sow and young pig samples, in the presence of similar faecal bacterial load (Fig. 2a). During 
acidified water and zinc administration, an increase in dfrA1 counts occurred in the young pig accommodation 
between W5 (mean 4.17 log10 copies/g DM, standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.80) and W7 (mean 5.58 log10 
copies/g DM, SEM 0.65), and a decrease in ermA between W5 (mean 6.83 log10 copies/g DM, SEM 1.44) and W7 
(2.70 log10 copies/g DM, SEM 1.17). There were no marked changes in the
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
levels of tetB, ermB and tetQ during 
acidified water and zinc administration.

Chlortetracycline administration (W8-W10) was associated with a decrease in tetB gene copy number in the 
young pig accommodation between W9 (mean 6.95 log10 copies/g DM, SEM 0.79) and W10 (mean 3.29 log10 
copies/g DM, SEM 0.79) with no significant changes in tetQ, ermA, ermB or dfrA1 levels being observed dur-
ing chlortetracycline administration. Tylosin administration (W11-W25) did not have an effect on AMR gene

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
counts in the young pig accommodation following withdrawal from chlortetracycline. Increases in the majority 
of AMR genes being observed were seen from W21 to W24 in both the young pig and dry sow accommodation, 
which coincided with an increase in bacterial load, suggesting that this increase was independent of antimicrobial 
administration (see Supplementary Materials 3 for detailed statistical model outputs).

AMR gene abundances and microbial diversity.  16S rRNA gene metabarcoding was

carried out to 
provide context on faecal microbiota development in the young pigs and whether changes in alpha diversity were 
linked to AMR gene abundances. Notable stepwise increases in measures of alpha diversity (both SIs and ISIs) 
occurred during the first 4 weeks of life (Fig. 3), highlighting an expected rapid increase in microbiota complexity. 
Even in faecal samples with low alpha diversity, comparable numbers of AMR genes were observed when compar-
ing to nursing sow samples

(Fig. 4a), 21 of which were ubiquitous across sampling location and time point. The majority of the 60 genes that 
were present in both locations were more abundant (however, in the same order of magnitude) in the young pig 
accommodation. There was noticeably higher AMR gene richness within the young pig accommodation com-

When examining the proportion of reads associated with each antibiotic class, AMR genes associated with 
tetracycline, macrolide (MLS) and aminoglycoside resistance predominated across all samples (Fig. 4b). With a 
few exceptions, these proportional results were consistent across the triplicate biological

tional results were also broadly similar for the dry sows and young pigs on and between W7 and W25, despite the 
fact that the young pigs received tylosin from weeks 11 to 25.

The biggest change in the proportion of reads associated with each antimicrobial class occurred on W9 in 
both sampling locations. In the young pig accommodation, there was a proportional increase in reads associated 
with cross-class resistance (CCR). In the dry sow accommodation, the increase

despite the young pigs having spent several months on in-feed antibiotics (Fig. 4c). Genes associated with CCR 
were not detected in the dry sow accommodation on W7 and W9, with only a single gene detected on W25.

During the last week of treatment (W36), and two (W45) and five (W57) months after cessation of treatment,

Discussion
When designing this study, our first hypothesis was that there would be a reservoir of AMR genes within the 
faecal microbiome, which would increase in both abundance and diversity in response to
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
in-feed antimicro-
bial administration. Furthermore, we anticipated that AMR gene abundance would be inversely related to faecal 
microbiome diversity. Whilst large cross-sectional studies have been instrumental in furthering our understand-
ing of AMR gene abundance and diversity across different livestock systems12,21,35, they have not provided the 
granularity of data and medicines usage history required to test these hypotheses. For this reason, we chose to 
undertake a longitudinal

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
dissection of a single commercial pig unit, which included three group in-feed antibiotic 
treatment regimens and a partial depopulation event.

Measured AMR genes consistently high across the unit.  Although previous work has demonstrated 
high baseline levels of specific AMR genes36 and phenotypic resistance in Escherichia coli isolates37,38 in unmedi-
cated pigs, our initial expectation was that AMR gene abundances would markedly increase in response to anti-
microbial administration as a

result of selective pressure being exerted on specific genes39. In agreement with

previous work, we showed high levels of all studied AMR genes in the non-medicated dry sows, presumably as 
a consequence of the strong selection pressure exerted by this farm’s history of high antimicrobial usage. The 
levels of the five AMR genes studied in the young pigs reflected those of the sow

population, whilst prolonged 
exposure to two different in-feed antibiotic regimens in the young pigs and a combined in-feed antibiotic regi-
men in the dry sows had no marked effect on AMR gene counts, potentially suggesting that they have reached 
saturation within the faecal bacterial populations39. Curiously, the antibiotics used (chlortetracycline and tylosin) 
were still clinically effective on this farm, suggesting that despite a high abundance of resistance genes within 
the faecal

microbiome, that they were not present, or at least not active, within the organisms of clinical inter-
est, i.e. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Actinobacillus pleuopneumoniae and Lawsonia 
intracellularis.

Interestingly, some of the targeted AMR genes (i.e. tetQ and ermB) were present in higher copy numbers than 
the 16S rRNA gene at the majority of the studied time points. This is consistent with the work of other groups,

gene in agricultural faecal and wastewater samples. It is worth noting that these AMR gene copy numbers are 
orders of magnitude higher than in samples obtained from other environments, such as sediments, soil and river 
water41,42. Collectively, these findings suggest that some

bacteria are carrying multiple copies of particular AMR 
genes.

Changes  in AMR  gene  abundances  were  not  associated  with  antimicrobial  exposure.  
Week-to-week fluctuations in AMR gene abundance in both young pigs and dry sows were apparent, however 
the most marked changes were generally not associated with antimicrobial administration. In fact, the larg-
est increases in AMR gene abundance were seen across all genes and in both classes of stock at the same time 
(W21-W24) which
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
coincided with an increase in 16S rRNA gene copies, hence suggesting an as yet undefined 
environmental influence on bacterial load and consequently AMR gene abundance. A previous cross-sectional 
study highlighted that only 10–42% of the variation in AMR gene levels could be explained by factors included 
in statistical models (including lifetime antimicrobial exposure), suggesting that AMR gene levels are strongly 
influenced by a variety of other elements43. Whilst these could be related to
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
feed changes, the fact that the dry 
sows and young pigs were housed differently and fed different diets44 would suggest that this effect is due to some 
other factors affecting the entire farm, such as housing and management35,45,46, environmental conditions46 or the 
introduction of an infectious agent.

Microbiome alpha diversity was not affected by antimicrobial exposure.  Similar to the studied 
AMR genes, fluctuations in microbiome alpha diversity were apparent in both dry sow and young
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
pig accom-
modation samples. These changes were clearly more pronounced in the young pigs, as the alpha diversity of the 
faecal microbiome increased from nursing to finishing, which has been shown previously47,48. However, changes 
in the microbiome associated with antimicrobial treatment were not observed. Previous work has demonstrated 
that sub-therapeutic administration of chlortetracycline and tylosin had no impact on alpha diversity indices47,49. 
Whilst changes in relative abundances of
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
specific taxa have been observed in response to tylosin administration, it 
was previously reported that these shifts were temporary, suggesting that the gut microbiota post-weaning seems 
to be resilient to perturbation by antimicrobial agents47. Despite using markedly higher levels of chlortetracycline 
and tylosin (300 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively), our results also showed that antimicrobial treatment did not 
impact on microbiome diversity in the young pigs.

AMR gene abundances are high
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
in nursing piglets with low microbiome diversity.  With respect 
to our second hypothesis, even when the young pig faecal microbiome was at its least diverse during the suck-
ling period, the AMR gene levels were comparable to that of the nursing sows. Although microbiome diversity 
increased dramatically in the piglets during the first few weeks of life, as reflected in previous studies47,50–53, this 
was not associated with changes in AMR gene prevalence. We expected, as others have proposed,
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
that changes 
in the microbiota would influence AMR gene levels20,44,54, but in fact the high levels of studied AMR genes in the 
young pigs reflected that of the farm’s sow population. The most obvious explanation for this is a combination of 
vertical and horizontal transmission of bacteria at or shortly after birth55,56. The presence of comparable levels of 
AMR genes in both sows and piglets and the associated large differences in microbiome diversity suggest that the 
AMR genes studied
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
appear to either be widespread across multiple taxa or highly concentrated within dominant 
taxa present throughout all stages of microbiota development.

High AMR gene diversity and cross-class resistance genes in young pigs.  Metagenomic sequenc-
ing revealed a diverse set of AMR genes in the presence and absence of antimicrobial treatment, which reflects 
findings in other recent work19. Specifically, genes associated with tetracycline and macrolide resistance pre-
dominated. This is not
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
surprising given the history of high levels of tetracycline and macrolide use on this farm. 
Reassuringly, there was no evidence of co-selection between antimicrobial classes following chlortetracycline or 
tylosin administration. This is a significant finding and relevant to the principles of antimicrobial stewardship, 
where veterinary surgeons are actively discouraged from using fluoroquinolones and 3rd/4th generation cephalo-
sporins, so as to minimise the risk that resistance to these

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf

selected for in livestock.

What was evident, were the large numbers of genes associated with cross-class resistance (CCR) in the young 
pig accommodation samples taken on W7 and W9 and how these reduced by W25 and were almost absent from 
the unmedicated sows. The presence of these genes was not associated with the administration of chlortetracy-
cline and tylosin in this study. Although the current study design does not allow us to
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
disentangle temporal effects 
versus the effect of different treatments, it is interesting to note that the CCR genes were already highly abundant 
at W7, following a period of in-feed zinc administration and the use of acidified water. Copper and zinc salts are 
commonly administered in-feed at supranutritional levels due to their antimicrobial properties, with increasing 
doses of zinc oxide being previously shown to increase the abundance of both tetracycline and sulphonamide 
resistance
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
genes in weaned pigs57,58.

The metagenomic sequencing results for the dry sow accommodation on W9 were unexpected. All three 
biological replicates demonstrated an increase in the proportion of reads associated with sulphonamide and 
aminoglycoside resistance. The richness of AMR genes also doubled at this time point compared to W7, despite 
no antimicrobial administration to this group of pigs. An increase in AMR gene diversity was also seen in the 
young pig accommodation at the same time

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
point, however the increase was seen in beta-lactam resistance genes, 
CCR genes and genes associated with other antimicrobial classes. This is unlikely to be an artefact, given that this 
observation was seen across two different locations at the same time and five of the six biological replicates. This

consequence of an undefined environmental factor affecting the whole farm, where the two 
groups of pigs respond differently with regards to faecal AMR gene diversity.

Persistently high abundances of AMR genes after partial depopulation.  The partial depopulation 
at the end of the study involved considerable antibiotic use, with every sow on the farm receiving in-feed tiamulin 
and chlortetracycline. The treated sows were followed for five months after this treatment, during a period where
----
Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
antibiotic use on the farm declined nearly twenty-fold. Despite such dramatic changes in antibiotic usage, there 
were no marked changes in AMR gene abundances. This therefore begs the question as to how long (if at all) it 
would take to see reductions in AMR gene levels following the reduction or cessation of antimicrobial use on 
farms with a previous history of high-level use. We propose that the long-term use of these treatments has led to 
wide and stable dissemination of relevant

resistance genes throughout the gastrointestinal microbial population 
of the pigs.

conclusion
AMR gene abundance and diversity on this unit were high in both dry sows and young pigs, likely as a conse-
quence of historic antimicrobial usage. In this context, in-feed antibiotic administration (chlortetracycline and 
tylosin) did not affect faecal AMR gene abundance or diversity, suggesting that genes under positive selection in 
the presence of these antibiotics have already become stably

Source: 41598_2020_Article_58659.pdf
integrated into the faecal microbiome. This would 
also potentially explain the failure of AMR gene levels to decline following dramatic reductions in antimicrobial 
use on the farm. Acidified water and zinc supplementation were linked to an increase in AMR gene diversity, 
which importantly included CCR genes, which decayed quickly after their withdrawal. This study did not identify 
which bacteria carried these AMR genes or indeed which genes were being expressed. Future work therefore 
needs

to determine in what organisms these genes are not only present, but also active.

Chatbots: Are they Really Useful?

Chatbots are computer programs that interact with users using natural lan-
guages. This technology started in the 1960’s; the aim was to see if chatbot
systems could fool users that they were real humans. However, chatbot sys-
tems are not only built to mimic human conversation, and entertain users.
In this paper, we investigate other applications where chatbots could be
useful such as education, information retrival, business,
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
and e-commerce.
A range of chatbots with useful applications, including several based on the
ALICE/AIML architecture, are presented in this paper.

Chatbots sind Computerprogramme, die mit Benutzern in natürlicher Spra-
che kommunizieren. Die ersten Programme gab es in den 60er Jahren; das
Ziel war festzustellen, ob Chatbots Benutzer davon überzeugen könnten,
dass sie in Wirklichkeit Menschen seien. Chatbots werden aber nicht nur
gebaut, um menschliche Kommunikation nachzuahmen und um
----

zu unterhalten. In diesem Artikel untersuchen wir andere Anwendungen
für Chatbots, zum Beispiel in Bildung, Suchmaschinen, kommerzielle An-
wendungen und e-commerce. Wir stellen eine Reihe von Chatbots mit nütz-
lichen Anwendungen vor, einschliesslich mehrerer Chatbots, die auf der
ALICE/AIML Architektur basieren.

1 Introduction

The need of conversational agents has become acute with the widespread
use of personal machines with the wish to communicate and the desire of
their makers
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
to provide natural language interfaces (Wilks, 1999)

Just as people use language for human communication, people want to use their lan-
guage to communicate with computers. Zadrozny et al. (2000) agreed that the best way
to facilitate Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is by allowing users “to express their
interest, wishes, or queries directly and naturally, by speaking, typing, and pointing”.
This was the driver behind the development of chatbots. A chatbot system is a soft-
ware program that
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
interacts with users using natural language. Different terms have
been used for a chatbot such as: machine conversation system, virtual agent, dialogue
system, and chatterbot. The purpose of a chatbot system is to simulate a human conver-
sation; the chatbot architecture integrates a language model and computational algo-

rithms to emulate informal chat communication between a human user and a computer
using natural
----

language.

Initially, developers built and used chatbots for fun, and used simple keyword match-
ing techniques to ﬁnd a match of a user input, such as ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966,
1967). The seventies and eighties, before the arrival of graphical user interfaces, saw
rapid growth in text and natural-language interface research, e.g. Cliff and Atwell
(1987), Wilensky et al. (1988). Since that time, a range of new chatbot architectures
have been developed, such as: MegaHAL (Hutchens, 1996), CONVERSE
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
(Batacharia
et al., 1999), ELIZABETH (Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2002), HEXBOT (2004) and AL-
ICE (2007). With the improvement of data-mining and machine-learning techniques,
better decision-making capabilities, availability of corpora, robust linguistic annota-
tions/processing tools standards like XML and its applications, chatbots have become
more practical, with many commercial applications (Braun, 2003).

In this paper, we will present practical chatbot applications, showing that chatbots
are
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
found in daily life, such as help desk tools, automatic telephone answering sys-
tems, tools to aid in education, business and e-commerce. We begin by discussing the
ALICE/AIML chatbot architecture and the pattern matching techniques used within
it in section 2; it is easy to build an ALICE-style chatbot, just by supplying a set of
chat-patterns in AIML format. Section 3 describes our development of a Java program
that can convert a machine readable text (corpus) to the AIML format used by
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
ALICE,
allowing different re-trained versions of ALICE to be developed to serve as tools in
different domains. Section 4 presents a chatbot as tool of entertainment; a chatbot as
a tool to learn and practice a language is discussed is section 5. Section 6 shows a
chatbot as an information retrieval tool; using a chatbot in business, e-commerce and
other ﬁelds is presented in section 7. Our conclusion is presented in section 8.

2 The ALICE Chatbot System

A.L.I.C.E. (Artiﬁcial Intelligence
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
Foundation, 2007; Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2003a; Wal-
lace, 2003) is the Artiﬁcial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity, which was ﬁrst imple-
mented by Wallace in 1995. Alice’s knowledge about English conversation patterns is
stored in AIML ﬁles. AIML, or Artiﬁcial Intelligence Mark-up Language, is a derivative
of Extensible Mark-up Language (XML). It was developed by Wallace and the Alicebot
free software community from 1995 onwards to enable people to input dialogue pattern
knowledge into
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
chatbots based on the A.L.I.C.E. open-source software technology.

AIML consists of data objects called AIML objects, which are made up of units called
topics and categories. The topic is an optional top-level element, has a name attribute
and a set of categories related to that topic. Categories are the basic unit of knowledge
in AIML. Each category is a rule for matching an input and converting to an output,
and consists of a pattern, which matches against the user input, and a template,
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
which

30

LDV-FORUM

Chatbots: Are they Really Useful?

is used in generating the ALICE chatbot answer. The format of AIML is as follows:

<aiml version="1.0">
<topic name="the topic">
<category>
<pattern>PATTERN</pattern>
<that>THAT</that>
<template>Template</template>
</category>

..
..

</topic>
</aiml>

The <that> tag is optional and means that the current pattern depends on a previous

chatbot output.

The AIML pattern is simple, consisting only of words, spaces, and the wildcard
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
sym-
bols _ and *. The words may consist of letters and numerals, but no other characters.
Words are separated by a single space, and the wildcard characters function like words.
The pattern language is case invariant. The idea of the pattern matching technique is
based on ﬁnding the best, longest, pattern match.

2.1 Types of ALICE/AIML Categories

There are three types of categories: atomic categories, default categories, and recursive
categories.

a. Atomic categories: are those with
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
patterns that do not have wildcard symbols, _ and

*, e.g.:

<category>

<pattern>10 Dollars</pattern>
<template>Wow, that is cheap. </template>

</category>

In the above category, if the user inputs ‘10 dollars’, then ALICE answers ‘WOW,
that is cheap’.

b. Default categories: are those with patterns having wildcard symbols * or _. The wild-
card symbols match any input but they differ in their alphabetical order. Assuming
the previous input 10 Dollars, if the robot does not ﬁnd the previous
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
category with
an atomic pattern, then it will try to ﬁnd a category with a default pattern such as:

<category>

<pattern>10 *</pattern>
<template>It is ten.</template>

</category>

So ALICE answers ‘It is ten’.

Band 22 (1) – 2007

31

Abu Shawar, Atwell

c. Recursive categories: are those with templates having <srai> and <sr> tags, which re-
fer to recursive reduction rules. Recursive categories have many applications: sym-
bolic reduction that reduces complex grammatical forms to simpler
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
ones; divide and
conquer that splits an input into two or more subparts, and combines the responses
to each; and dealing with synonyms by mapping different ways of saying the same
thing to the same reply.

c.1 Symbolic reduction

<category>

<pattern>DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE * IS</pattern>
<template>

<srai>What is <star/></srai>

</template>

</category>

In this example <srai> is used to reduce the input to simpler form “what is
*”.

c.2 Divide and
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
conquer

<category>

<pattern>YES*</pattern>
<template>

<srai>YES</srai>
<sr/>
<template>

</category>

The input is partitioned into two parts, “yes” and the second part; * is matched
with the <sr/> tag. <sr/>=<srai><star/></srai>

c.3 Synonyms

<category>

<pattern>HALO</pattern>
<template>

<srai>Hello</srai>

</template>

</category>

The input is mapped to another form, which has the same meaning.

2.2 ALICE Pattern Matching Algorithm

Before the matching process starts, a normalization
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
process is applied for each input,
to remove all punctuation; the input is split into two or more sentences if appropriate;
and converted to uppercase. For example, if input is: “I do not know. Do you, or will
you, have a robots.txt ﬁle?” Then after the normalization it will be: “DO YOU OR WILL
YOU HAVE A ROBOTS DOT TXT FILE”.

32

LDV-FORUM

Chatbots: Are they Really Useful?

After the normalisation, the AIML interpreter tries to match word by word to obtain
the longest pattern match, as we
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
expect this normally to be the best one. This behaviour
can be described in terms of the Graphmaster set of ﬁles and directories, which has a set
of nodes called nodemappers and branches representing the ﬁrst words of all patterns
and wildcard symbols (Wallace, 2003).

Assume the user input starts with word X and the root of this tree structure is a
folder of the ﬁle system that contains all patterns and templates, the pattern matching
algorithm uses depth ﬁrst search techniques:

1. If the
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
folder has a subfolder starts with underscore then turn to ,“_/” , scan

through it to match all words sufﬁxed X, if no match then:

2. Go back to folder, try to ﬁnd a subfolder start with word X, if so turn to “X/”,

scan for matching the tail of X. Patterns are matched. If no match then:

3. Go back to the folder, try to ﬁnd a subfolder start with star notation, if so, turn to
“*/”, try all remaining sufﬁxes of input following “X” to see if one match. If no
match was found, change directory
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
back to the parent of this folder, and put “X”
back on the head of the input.

When a match is found, the process stops, and the template that belongs to that

category is processed by the interpreter to construct the output.

There are more than 50,000 categories in the current public-domain ALICE “brain”,
slowly built up over several years by the Botmaster, Richard Wallace, the researcher
who maintained and edited the database of the original ALICE. However all these cat-
egories are manually
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
“hand-coded”, which is time-consuming, and restricts adapta-
tion to new discourse-domains and new languages. In the following section we will
present the automation process we developed, to re-train ALICE using a corpus based
approach.

3 Learning AIML from a Dialogue Corpus Training Dataset

We developed a Java program that converts a text corpus to the AIML chatbot language
model format. Two versions of the program were initially developed. The ﬁrst version
is based on simple pattern
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
template category, so the ﬁrst turn of the speech is the pat-
tern to be matched with the user input, and the second is the template that holds the
robot answer. This version was tested using the English-language Dialogue Diversity
Corpus (DDC, Mann, 2002; Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2003a) to investigate the prob-
lems of utilising dialogue corpora. The dialogue corpora contain linguistic annotation
that appears during the spoken conversation such as overlapping, and using linguistic
ﬁllers. To
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
handle the linguistic annotations and ﬁllers, the program is composed of four
phases as follows:

Phase One: Read the dialogue text from the corpus and insert it in a vector.

Band 22 (1) – 2007

33

Abu Shawar, Atwell

Phase Two: Text reprocessing modules, where all linguistic annotations such as over-

lapping, ﬁllers and other linguistic annotations are ﬁltered.

Phase Three: converter module, where the pre-processed text is passed to the con-
verter to consider the ﬁrst turn as a pattern
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
and the second as a template. Re-
moving all punctuation from the patterns and converting it to upper case is done
during this phase.

Phase Four: Copy these atomic categories in an AIML ﬁle.

For example, assume the DDC corpus has the following sample of XML-tagged text:

<u who=F72PS002>
<s n="32"><w ITJ>Hello<c PUN>.
</u>
<u who=PS000>
<s n="33"><w ITJ>Hello <w NP0>Donald<c PUN>.
</u>

After applying the text processing module in phase two, the result is:

F72PS002: Hello
PS000: Hello
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
Donald

The corresponding AIML atomic category can be generated in phase 3:

<category>
<pattern>HELLO</pattern>
<template>Hello Donald</template>
</category>

The second version of the program has a more general approach to ﬁnding the best
match against user input from the training dialogue. Two machine learning category-
generation techniques were adapted, the “ﬁrst word” approach, and the most signiﬁ-
cant word approach.

In the ﬁrst word approach we assumed that the ﬁrst word of an
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
utterance may be a
good clue to an appropriate response: if we cannot match the input against a complete
corpus utterance, then at least we can try matching just the ﬁrst word of a corpus
utterance. For each atomic pattern, we generated a default version that holds the ﬁrst
word followed by wildcard to match any text, and then associated it with the same
atomic template.

One advantage of the Machine-Learning approach to re-training ALICE is that we
can automatically build AIML from a corpus
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
even if we don’t understand the domain
or even the language; to demonstrate this, the program was tested using the Corpus of
Spoken Afrikaans (van Rooy, 2003). Unfortunately this approach still failed to satisfy
our trial users, who found some of the responses of the chatbot were inappropriate;
so instead of simply assuming that the ﬁrst word is the best “signpost”, we look for
the word in the utterance with the highest “information content”, the word that is most
speciﬁc to this utterance
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
compared to other utterances in the corpus. This should be the

34

LDV-FORUM

Chatbots: Are they Really Useful?

word that has the lowest frequency in the rest of the corpus. We chose the most signif-
icant approach to generate the default categories, because usually in human dialogues
the intent of the speakers is best represented in the least-frequent, highest-information
word. We extracted a local least frequent word list from the Afrikaans corpus, and
then compared it with each token in
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
each pattern to specify the most signiﬁcant word
within that pattern. Four categories holding the most signiﬁcant word were added to
handle the positions of this word ﬁrst, middle, last or alone. The feedback showed
improvement in user satisfaction (Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2003b).

The same learning techniques were used to re-train different versions of ALICE as
will be shown in the following sections. The Pandorabot (2002) web-hosting service was
used to publish these prototypes.
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
Pandorabots.com hosts thousands of chatbots built
using the AIML format. The most popular Pandorabots for the last 24 hours web-page
regularly lists chatbots developed by researchers and hobbyists, and also some com-
mercial systems as shown in ﬁgure 1. For example, Cyber-Sandy and Nickie act as por-
tals to adult-entertainment websites; Jenny introduces the English2Go website, and lets
English language learners practise their chatting technique. The ﬁrst Pandorabot chat-
bots were text-only:
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
the user typed a sentence via keyboard, and then the chatbot reply
appeared onscreen as text too. Now some Pandorabot chatbots incorporate speech syn-
thesis; for example, Jenny talks with an educated British accent, via a speech synthesis
engine. However, Pandorabot chatbots cannot recognise speech: the user still has to
type their input via keyboard. This is because existing Markov-model-based speech
recognition is still too error-prone, and does not ﬁt the AIML key-phrase model. Exist-
ing

speech recognition systems would take a lot of time and memory trying to recog-
nise everything in the input, even though little of this is subsequently needed by the
AIML language model; and speech recognition errors may cause inappropriate AIML
patterns to be matched (Atwell, 2005).

4 A Chatbot as a Tool of Entertainment

The initial aim of building chatbot systems was to mimic human conversation and
amuse users. The ﬁrst attempt at building chatbots was ELIZA, which was created
in the 60’s
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
by Joseph Weizenbaum to emulate a psychotherapist in clinical treatment
(Weizenbaum, 1966, 1967). The idea was simple and based on keyword matching. The
input is inspected for the presence of a keyword. If such a word is found, the sentence
is mapped according to a rule associated with the keyword; if not, a connected free
remark, or under certain conditions an earlier transformation, is retrieved. For example,
if the input includes the keyword “mother”, ELIZA can respond “Tell me more
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
about
your family”. This rule is inspired by the theory that mother and family are central to
psychological problems, so a therapist should encourage the patient to open up about
their family; but the ELIZA program does not really ‘understand’ this psychological
strategy, it merely matches the keyword and regurgitates a standard response. To keep
the conversation going, ELIZA has to produce responses which encourage the patient
to reﬂect and introspect, and this is done mechanistically using

some ﬁxed phrases if no

keyword match is found such as “Very interesting. Please go on.”, or “Can you think of
a special example?”. Figure 2 shows an example of chatting with ELIZA. When ELIZA
was released, at least some users believed that they were talking to a real therapist, and
spent hours talking about their problems.

Even though ELIZA was not able to understand, and a user can realise

Figure 2: A sample of conversation with ELIZA (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000)

of chatting that many ELIZA responses are extracted from users input, it was the inspi-
ration for many modern chatbots which aim mainly to fool users that they are talking
to another human as applied in the “imitation game” (Turing Test, Turing, 1950).

After ELIZA, a lot of chatbots or human-computer dialogue systems have been
developed either to simulate
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
different ﬁctional or real personalities using different
algorithms of pattern matching, such as simple keyword-matching in ELIZA, or
more linguistically-sophisticated models such as using Markov Models like MegaHAL
(Hutchens and Alder, 1998).

Another example used in this ﬁeld is ALICE, the chatbot engine we used in our
research, which was built basically to entertain users and talk to them as a real person.
ALICE won the Loebner prize (2003) competition three times in 2000, 2001, and
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
2004.
The Loebner competition is the way used nowadays to judge how much a chatbot could
convince a user that it is a real human by chatting for 10 minutes. Figure 3 shows an
example of chatting with ALICE. In fact this conversation seems good, however if you
try to chat more, you will probably ﬁgure out that:

• ALICE does not save the history of conversation.

• ALICE does not truly understand what you said; it gives you the responses from

the knowledge domain stored in her “brain”.

These

are also the most common drawbacks in almost all chatbots.

5 A Chatbot as a Tool to Learn and Practice a Language

We used our Java program described in section 3, to read a Corpus of Spoken Afrikaans
(Korpus Gesproke Afrikaans) (van Rooy, 2003) and to convert it to the AIML format
ﬁles. Since the corpus does not cover topics like greetings, some manual atomic cate-
gories were added for this purpose and the default ones were generated by the program

automatically. As a result two Afrikaans chatbots were generated: Afrikaana (2002),
which speaks just Afrikaans, and a bilingual version speaking English and Afrikaans,
named AVRA (2002); this was inspired by our observation that the Korpus Gesproke
Afrikaans actually includes some English, as Afrikaans speakers are generally bilingual
and switch between
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
languages comfortably. We mounted prototypes of the chatbots on
websites using Pandorabot service, and encouraged open-ended testing and feedback
from remote users in South Africa. Unfortunately, users found that many responses
were not related to the topic or nonsense. The reasons behind most of the users’ feed-
back can be related to three issues. Firstly the dialogue corpus context does not cover a
wide range of domains, so Afrikaana can only “talk about” the domain of the training
corpus.
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
Secondly, the repeated approach that we used to solve the problem of deter-
mining the pattern and the template in case of more than two speakers may lead to
incoherent transcripts: if the training corpus does not have straightforward equivalents
of “user” and “chatbot” then it can be non-trivial to model turn-taking correctly in
Machine-Learnt AIML (Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2005b). Thirdly, our machine-learnt
models have not included linguistic analysis markup, such as grammatical, semantic
or
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
dialogue-act annotations (Atwell, 1996; Atwell et al., 2000), as ALICE/AIML makes
no use of such linguistic knowledge in generating conversation responses. However,
users found it an interesting tool to practise the language and enjoyed chatting, and
we concluded that even with its key-word based matching technique, a chatbot could
be used as a tool for unknown languages, where “unknown” means (i) unknown to
the chatbot author/developer, and/or (ii) unknown to computational linguistics,
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
that
is, where there is a shortage of existing tools to deal with the languages.

Chatbots: Are they Really Useful?

Jia (2004b) also found that with the absence of linguistic knowledge and the inability
to understand users’ input, many answers will be nonsense. Moreover, Jia claimed that
with this key word matching, a chatbot system could not work as a teaching assistant
program in foreign language learning. This was his conclusion from an experiment in
China to see if a
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
chatbot could replace a chat partner with users who learn a foreign
language. Students from universities and colleges were asked to chat with ALICE, stu-
dents only knew that they were chatting with a partner to help them learning English.
After a short time of chatting, most of students ﬁgured out that Alice was an AI agent
not a real human. A sample of chatting done in this experiment is shown in ﬁgure 4.

Figure 4: A sample of chatting between a student in China and ALICE (from Jia (2004b))

Analysis of all dialogues generated and feedback from students revealed that: 1256
users chatted with Alice, 88% of them chatted only once and did not come back to the
site; the duration of chatting was short; 17% made positive comments such as: “you
are
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
so nice”, “you are clever”, etc, and 24% evaluated it negatively.
In this respect,
Jia concluded that the failure of this experiment is down to the pattern matching tech-
nique used in Alice which is based on key-word matching without any attempt to un-
derstand what is said. The topics of chatting covered every aspect in our daily life,
for example: study, emotion, life, computer, free time, travel/world and job. 11.39%
of students talk about English study, and exams, and 13% mentioned love,
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
mostly stu-
dents younger than 30 years old dealt with Alice as a friend rather than as a teacher,
and told her some private emotional problems and experiences. Jia (2004b) concluded
that “the conversational chatbot should not only work as a teacher or learning partner
with rich special knowledge, but also as a dear friend who may enjoy the joy and suffer
the pain of the users”. After that Jia (2004a) developed an intelligent Web-Based teach-
ing system for foreign language learning which
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
consists of: natural language mark-up
language that labels grammar elements; natural language object model in Java which
represents the grammatical elements; natural language database; a communication re-
sponse mechanism which considers the discourse context, the world model and the
personality of the users and of the system itself.

In the same respect, Chantarotwong (2005) reported that “responses of most chatbots
are frequently predictable, redundant, lacking in personality, and having no
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
memory
of previous responses which could lead to very circular conversation.”

However, in contrast to these ﬁndings, Fryer and Carpenter (2006) claimed that “chat-
bots could provide a means of language practice for students anytime and virtually

Band 22 (1) – 2007

Abu Shawar, Atwell

anywhere”. Even though most chatbots are unable to detect spelling errors, and gram-
mar mistakes, they could still be useful for non-beginner students. Fryer and Carpen-
ter did an experiment where 211
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
students were asked to chat with ALICE and Jabber-
wocky chatbots. The feedback in general was that students enjoyed using the chatbots,
and felt more comfortable and relaxed conversing with the bots than a student partner
or teacher as in classical teaching. The authors listed other advantages of chatbots in
this domain: the chatbot could repeat the same material with students several times
without being bored, many bots used text and speech mode in responding which is
an opportunity to
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
practice the reading, and listening skills, and chatbots as new trends
improve students motivation towards learning.
In addition to this, if computers are
available in the class room, teachers could encourage students who ﬁnished their class
work early to talk to a chatbot and giving them a topic to focus on. An easy self analy-
sis could be achieved since most chatbots keep a transcript of the conversation where
students can evaluate themselves.

6 A Chatbot as Information Retrieval Tool

A
----

chatbot could be a useful tool in education, for example to practise language as
illustrated in section 5. Knill et al. (2004) found that using a chatbot to answer questions
will help the teacher to see where students have problems, what questions students ask,
and the generated logs ﬁle could be accessed to gauge student learning, and students
weaknesses. The authors developed the Soﬁa chatbot to assist in teaching Mathematics.
The Soﬁa chatbot has the ability to chat with users and at the
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
same time to chat with
other mathematical agents such as Pari and Mathmatica to help in solving Algebra
problems. The “brain” of the bot contains text ﬁles mainly focussing on maths and
other common knowledge to make Sophia friendly to use. Sophia was trained with
some jokes, and is familiar with movies in which maths plays a role. Sophia was used
at Harvard Mathmatics department. Results showed that teachers can use a chatbot to
look for problems as students use it to solve
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
problems.

Information Retrieval researchers recognise that techniques to answer questions from
document-sets have wide applications, beyond education; see for example the overview
of question-answering in restricted domains (Molla and Vicedo, 2007).
In a similar
application, we used a range of different retrained version of ALICE to retrieve answers
for questions in a range of topics (Abu Shawar et al., 2005; Abu Shawar and Atwell,
2005a,c). We adapted the Java program to the FAQ (Frequently
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
Asked Questions) in
the School of Computing (SoC) at University of Leeds, producing the FAQchat system.
Earlier systems were built to answer questions speciﬁcally about the Unix operating
system, e.g. Wilensky et al. (1988), Cliff and Atwell (1987); but the SoC FAQ also
covers other topics including teaching and research resources, how to book a room,
even “what is doughnuts?” (Friday morning staff meeting with an incentive to turn
up...) An FAQ has the advantage over other corpus training sets
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
in that there are clear
equivalents of “user” (Question) and “chatbot” (Answer) which simpliﬁes modelling
of turn-taking (Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2005b). The results returned from FAQchat

40

LDV-FORUM

are similar to ones generated by search engines such as Google, where the outcomes
are links to exact or nearest match web pages. Because of this similarity an interface
was built which accepts users input and produce two answers, one is generated from
the
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
FAQchat and the other is generated from Google after ﬁltering it to the FAQ of
SoC. An evaluation sheet was prepared which contains 15 information-seeking tasks or
questions on a range of different topics related to the FAQ database. 21 members of the
staff and students tried chatting with the interface as shown in ﬁgure 5; the following
is a summary of the feedback we obtained:

• Most staff and students preferred using the FAQchat for two main reasons:

1. The ability to give direct answers
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
sometimes while Google only gives links.

2. The number of links returned by the FAQchat is less than those returned by

Google for some questions, which saves time browsing/searching.

• Users who preferred Google justiﬁed their preference for two reasons:

1. Prior familiarity with using Google.

2. FAQchat seemed harder to steer with carefully chosen keywords, but more
often did well on the ﬁrst try. This happens because FAQchat gives answers
if the keyword matches a signiﬁcant word. The
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
same will occur if you re-
formulate the question and the FAQchat matches the same word. However
Google may give different answers in this case.

Feedback favourable to FAQchat was gained from almost all users, even those who
preferred Google. Overall, they found it a novel and interesting way to access the FAQ
using natural language questions. Overall, about two thirds of users managed to ﬁnd
answers by FAQchat, and about two thirds of the users preferred to use it. The aim
was not to try to
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
evaluate the two systems to come up with relative scores, but to show
that it is a viable alternative to Google and it could be used as a tool to access FAQ
databases. Our system is not restricted to the English language, other FAQ’s such as
Python FAQ which was found in English and Spanish were also used to generate an
FAQ-answering version of ALICE about Python in both English and Spanish languages
(Abu Shawar and Atwell, 2005b,a).

Gibbs et al. (2004) used a chatbot conversation to enhance
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
the learning of social
theory. They used an ALICE chatbot to build knowledge base that answers question
of type “tell me more about. . .” The model was tested by sociology undergraduates
studying the natural theory course.

Recently in 2006, Schumaker et al. retrained ALICE with 298 telecommunications-
related deﬁnitions. The experimental system was assigned to a different section of
an introductory Management of Information System course. Evaluations and results
show that “the ALICE dialog

system is promising as extensions readily come to mind
to target both knowledge delivery and acquisition” (Schumaker et al., 2007).

Nevertheless, Using a chatbot as an information retrieval system is not only restricted
to the education ﬁeld. The YPA “is a natural language dialogue system that allows
users to retrieve information from British Telecom’s Yellow pages” (Kruschwitz et al.,
1999, 2000). The yellow pages contain advertisements, with the advertiser name, and
contact information. The YPA system returns

conversation is started and the system asks users more details in order to give a user
the required address. The YPA is composed of Dialog Manager, Natural Language
front-end, Query Construction Component, and the Backend database. The Backend
includes relational database that contains tables extracted from the Yellow pages. The
conversation starts by accepting users’ input through a graphical user interface, then
the dialogue manager sent the textual input

those addresses were relevant to the original query. The YPA answers questions such
as “I need a plumber with an emergency service?”, “Which restaurants are there in

tion manager (PM), the dialog Manager (DM), and the Action Manager (AC). The pre-
sentation manager applies a shallow parsing technique to identify semantic and syn-
tactic information of interest from the user textual input. Then it translates the
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
user’s
input into a well formed XML message called the logical form. The dialogue manager
is responsible for matching concepts from user’s query to business rules found in the
knowledge domain. The business rules consist of a list of concepts together with some
meta data about the target product or service. If a match is found, the webpage asso-
ciated with that rule is presented to the user. Otherwise, the most important missing
concept is ﬁgured out by introducing questions to the user. The
----
Source: Bayan_Abu-Shawar_and_Eric_Atwell.pdf
role now is turned
to the action manager, which accesses the product that matched the query, and if the
user provides special preferences, a sorting algorithm is applied to yield a ranked list
of products. To make users trust the system, system must offer some explanation be-
fore producing a result, so the system summarizes user’s request by paraphrasing it
using the context history. Figure 7 presents a sample of conversation with the Happy

We have surveyed several chatbot systems which succeed in

practical domains like ed-

help people, facilitate their work, and their interaction with computers using natural
language; but not to replace the human role totally, or imitate human conversation per-

Antimicrobial therapy has provided the main component of chemotherapy against
bacterial pathogens. The effectiveness of this strategy has, however, been increasingly
challenged by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance which now threatens the
sustained utility of this approach. Humans and animals are constantly exposed to
bacteria and have developed effective strategies to control pathogens involving innate
and adaptive immune responses.

essential components of this response, speciﬁcally those which are amenable to

Antimicrobial chemotherapy has formed the cornerstone of our therapeutic strategy against
bacterial disease since penicillin was ﬁrst developed. Prior to this, developing host-based therapy
was a major focus, including Fleming’s original work on lysozyme, a humoral microbicide he
isolated while seeking antimicrobial factors in pus (1). The

Recent public health estimates suggest antimicrobial resistant

that two-thirds are nosocomial (3). The disability adjusted life
years of these infections approximates tuberculosis, inﬂuenza
and HIV combined (3). In addition, development of new
antimicrobials has been declining (4). There is thus a pressing
need to develop new antimicrobials, improved antimicrobial
stewardship, better diagnostics to identify the

CHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIMAL INNATE
IMMUNE RESPONSES TO PATHOGENIC
BACTERIA

Pathogenic bacteria commonly colonize healthy individuals
without causing disease. S. aureus is carried by >40% of
infants after birth and ∼50% of adults are permanent or
intermittent carriers (6, 7). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is
typically part of an individual’s fecal microbiota and healthy
individuals carry a large number of potentially pathogenic
strains (8). In other cases,
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
pathogens are harmless microbiome
constituents but cause opportunistic infections in patients
whose immune system is impaired by medical co-morbidity,
such as nosocomial enterococcal infections (9). This apparent
paradox, between common carriage but uncommon disease,
suggests most infections are readily controlled by the host
yet the speciﬁc microbicidal responses that control infection
when small numbers of colonizing bacteria translocate to new
sites is incompletely deﬁned. Broadly,
the
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
innate immune
system ensures a rapid response, working in concert with
any adaptive immune responses to the pathogen. There are
many components to the innate immune system including
mucosal barrier function, humoral factors released in mucosal
secretions and a range of innate cellular responses that are
not restricted to myeloid phagocytes but also include innate
lymphoid cells. These responses are modiﬁed through adaptive
immune responses, but the focus of this review is exclusively on
myeloid
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
phagocyte responses.

Professional phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) clear
bacteria from mucosa associated with a low-density microbiome,

stimulus

that can on repeat

for example the distal airway or bladder (10). Macrophages
play a critical role in the initial response as the resident
phagocytes in tissues, using pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) to detect pathogens and orchestrate the inﬂammatory
response. They are eﬃcient at phagocytosing bacteria and
ingested
utilize a range of

Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
microbicidal strategies to kill
bacteria. Tissue macrophage function is tightly controlled by
activation state which is regulated by a cell network including
epithelial, endothelial, T- and B- lymphocytes, as well as tissue
resident innate lymphoid cells. The resulting cytokine networks
reﬂect
the importance of environmental cues (11). Innate
immune memory ensures previous pathogen exposure modulates
macrophage function via epigenetic imprinting of monocytes to
induce “training” (enhanced

Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
microbicidal responses to repeat
challenge) and “tolerance” (reduced deleterious responses to
repeat challenge) to pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(12, 13). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) engagement of Toll-like
receptor (TLR) 4 is just one example amongst several of
stimulation be
a microbial
associated with tolerance manifest as reduced generation of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and reactive species (14). This has
implications for monocyte-derived macrophage populations but
the extent to which
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
it also inﬂuences resident macrophage
populations with distinct ontogeny remains to be established.
Though capable of avid phagocytosis, tissue macrophages have
a ﬁnite capacity to kill ingested bacteria (15). This capacity
can be diminished by interactions with other microorganisms
e.g., viruses, environmental factors or co-morbidity, resulting
in increased susceptibility to bacterial disease. For example,
both HIV-1 infection and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) impair alveolar

Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
macrophage (AM) killing
of pneumococci (16, 17). Furthermore, pathogenic bacteria
have evolved mechanisms to withstand microbicides, such as
antioxidant systems (18). Successful pathogens such as S. aureus
inhibit phagosomal maturation contributing to intracellular
survival (19), while others that are more readily killed may escape
killing in subsets of macrophages, as exempliﬁed by survival
of pneumococci in permissive CD169+ splenic macrophages
in murine and porcine models (20). Several
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
potentially AMR
pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa can
subvert phagosomal maturation in macrophages (21, 22).
Traditional paradigms of intracellular and extracellular bacteria
are blurring and the intracellular fate of the so-called extracellular
bacteria (including medically important ESKAPE pathogens,
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) is likely
a major determinant of infection outcome.

When the intracellular killing capacity of resident tissue
macrophages is
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
overwhelmed, they orchestrate recruitment of
neutrophils and other inﬂammatory cells. Murine models of
clodronate-mediated AM depletion illustrate how escalating
bacterial challenge shifts the role of AM from primary eﬀectors
of bacterial clearance to regulators of the inﬂammatory response,
with neutrophils required for pathogen clearance (15, 23). The
exhaustion of macrophage clearance capacity is likely also a
feature of systemic infections, as evidenced for Kupﬀer cells
in the liver and is

and organ dysfunction (25). Nevertheless, this inﬂammatory
response is essential and neutrophil deﬁciency results in severe
bacterial infection (26). Neutrophil microbicidal responses have
been extensively characterized and include ROS, AMP, divalent

such as the serine proteases contained in azurophilic granules
(e.g., cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase) and acid hydrolases

challenge (32). It is therefore essential to
limit these dysregulated inﬂammatory responses and induce
a more limited inﬂammatory response with optimal pathogen
clearance, by targeting microbicidal
responses. To target
potential bottlenecks in the host microbicidal response, we
must identify optimal responses that promote resilience in the
healthy population and patient groups in whom these fail. We
need to develop assays to assess the host response and eﬀect
of therapy.

extracellular bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) are summarized. Following phagocytosis of bacteria an initial microbicidal response occurs in the
phagolysosome (top panel). Speciﬁc effectors with demonstrated microbicidal roles differs based on the ingested organism, and include NADPH derived ROS,

that co-localize to bacteria-containing phagolysosomes include NO and mROS which have demonstrated roles in killing ingested pneumococci. A mitochondrial

well in pneumococcal models and also in some other extracellular bacterial infections (bottom panel). This involves an early shift to glycolysis and a progressive

IDENTIFYING HOST RESPONSES AS
TARGETS FOR IMMUNOMODULATION

A critical bottleneck in host defense involves macrophage
bacterial clearance (19, 33). However, therapeutic modulation
of this is impeded by limitations in our understanding of
microbicidal responses in tissue macrophages, which are often
inferred from neutrophils, monocytes or monocytic cell lines.
Well-established microbicidal mechanisms in other phagocytes
may not operate in tissue macrophages, which (excluding those
in
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
atherosclerotic plaques) lack the ability to produce the more
potent halogenated ROS like hypochlorous acid (34, 35). Some
microbicidal responses are more convincingly demonstrated in
mice than man, for example those involving nitric oxide (NO),
which may be produced at lower levels in human macrophages,
although several groups have detected it following bacterial
challenge (36). Eﬀective responses likely require combinations
of microbicidals. Deﬁning these has been limited by how well
in vitro
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
macrophage cultures mirror tissue macrophages in vivo.
Many tissue macrophages with low-level homeostatic turnover
arise from embryonic yolk sac or fetal liver hematopoietic stem
cell progenitors and are maintained by division of resident cells,
e.g., AM derived from fetal liver precursors (37). Monocyte-
derived macrophages (MDM) give rise to macrophages in
the gut and peritoneum, populations associated with a higher
turnover, but we cannot assume their microbicidal responses are
identical to
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
macrophages derived from embryonic progenitors.
In addition, tissue macrophage maturation is heavily inﬂuenced
by environmental cues and their transcriptional proﬁles are as
distinct as they are from monocytes (38).

Irrespective of these limitations there are many similarities
between microbicidal mechanisms of diﬀerent macrophage
populations. A range of primary human macrophages (including
MDM and AM) and murine models demonstrate an initial phase
of extensive intracellular killing, activated
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
in the phagosome. For
pathogens such as pneumococci, this is followed by a delayed
phase of bacterial killing, involving apoptosis-associated killing
that clears residual viable bacteria (16, 19, 33). These responses
often involve combinations of microbicidals (Figure 2),
for
example ROS and NO, which helps subvert pathogen resistance
(33). Tissue macrophages modify the phagosomal environment
to inhibit bacterial survival; phagolysosomal acidiﬁcation and
restriction of divalent metal cations
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
inhibits bacterial enzymes,
including manganese-containing
dismutase.
Nevertheless, the role of these responses is more established
in killing intracellular bacteria, compared to internalized
extracellular bacteria (39). These defenses are complemented by
AMP and proteases. Matrix metalloproteinase 12 contributes to
early killing of bacteria in macrophages (40). The cathelicidin
LL-37 enhances killing of bacteria including S. aureus in
macrophages and is taken up from exogenous sources
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
to
complement ROS generation and lysosome fusion (41). AMR in
E. coli can increase the sensitivity to AMP, suggesting host-based
strategies can synergize with antimicrobials or with antimicrobial
selective pressure (42). Similarly, a synthetic peptide derived
from human lactoferrin synergizes with antimicrobials against

superoxide

a carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (43). However,
there are also examples where mutations inducing AMR may
also enable resistance to AMP; modiﬁcation of K.

pneumoniae
lipid A not only enables resistance to polymyxins but also
β-defensins and human neutrophil peptide-1 (44). Many other
AMP and proteases contribute to microbicidal responses, but
the mechanism may be indirect. For example cathepsin D
enhances apoptosis-associated killing by increasing proteasomal
degradation of
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Mcl-1 (45).

(CRISPR)-associated nuclease Cas9 knock-out (GeCKO) pooled
libraries to human cells allows whole genome screening with the
potential to shed new light on microbicidal mechanisms (46, 47).
A further potential approach is to harness comparative biology
and aims to use convergent evolution of pathogens as they shift
species tropism (48) or divergent evolution within species as
they rapidly evolve under a host-selective pressure (49), to probe
microbicidal mechanisms. Nevertheless,
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
identifying microbicidal
mechanisms as targets for immunomodulation will also require
evidence that these are sub-optimally calibrated in patient groups
with increased susceptibility to bacterial disease. For example,
AM from patients with COPD fail to enhance mitochondrial ROS
(mROS) production following bacterial challenge (16). This is
important since mROS has recently emerged as a key microbicide
aﬀecting bacterial killing in the macrophage phagolysosome
(33, 50). Evaluation of potential

Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
microbicidal targets will also
require application of super-resolution microscopy and other
advanced imaging modalities, combined with advances in probes,
optics and analytics to provide temporal and spatial resolution of
microbicidal generation. In the past, generation at a population
level using automated systems such as ﬂow cytometry has been
assumed to be a surrogate for this but may be insuﬃcient to
allow optimal characterization. In vivo imaging is also a valuable
adjunct and comparative

medicine using large animals such as

to restore functional phagocyte numbers in patients receiving
bone marrow-suppressive chemotherapy. GM-/G-CSF have also
been investigated in patients with sepsis, with a meta-analysis
suggesting a trend toward beneﬁt (71, 72). Timing may be
important with GM-CSF and it may have most eﬃcacy when
targeted to patients with low monocyte HLA-DR (73). Whilst
the impact on microbicidal responses is often not studied,
a recent clinical trial showed GM-CSF

targeted to critically
ill patients with defects in ex vivo neutrophil phagocytosis
could ameliorate this defect and increase monocyte HLA-DR
(54). Both GM-CSF and IFN-γ will, with subtle diﬀerences,
contribute to macrophage activation phenotypes that promote
microbicidal responses, particularly against pathogens with
signiﬁcant
intracellular survival. Other cytokines will have
similar eﬀects (74). As with many other approaches listed, each

aﬀecting microbicidal responses (Table 2). For example, IFN-γ
can also enhance myeloid cell recruitment in clinical trials (68).

Other investigational approaches include the use of check-
point inhibitors, such as anti-programmed cell death protein-1
(anti-PD-1) or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-
4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies (73). These inhibitors
aim to reverse suppression of T-cell inﬂammatory responses.

being
tested in a clinical trial in sepsis, and while such therapies are
anticipated to modulate the inﬂammatory response, they may
also target microbicidal responses. For example, there is a case
report of Nivolumab being used in combination with IFN-γ to
successfully treat an intractable fungal infection (57). A PD-1
ligand inhibitor has also been shown to increase monocyte
HLA-DR expression (76). Other immune modulating strategies
that can be expected to modulate microbicidal

include recombinant IL-7, which corrects lymphopenia and
will enhance IFN-γ, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),
which in addition to immunomodulation enhances pathogen
clearance
Immunomodulatory
peptides have also been combined with IVIG, speciﬁcally the P4

lipopeptide Pneumococcal surface adhesin A), resulting in

REPURPOSED DRUGS TO TARGET
MICROBICIDAL RESPONSES IN
PRE-CLINICAL MODELS

Studies in relevant in vitro and animal models, and human
patient groups, can identify host microbicidal targets. But there is
then a need to develop therapeutic approaches to modulate these

targets. This will inevitably be constrained by cost, but this can
potentially be reduced by re-purposing existing agents that are
found to modify the host response of interest

Phagocytosis of bacteria activates phagosomal microbicidal

usually a rate limiting process, in conditions such as COPD
macrophage phagocytosis may be reduced. This is associated
with increased airway bacterial burden (62). This defect is
related to cellular oxidative stress (62, 81). Nrf2 agonists are in

downregulation of platelet-activating

for the enhanced clearance was not established beyond the
association of
increased clearance with reduced sickle cell-
associated inﬂammation. In the case of M. tuberculosis, statins
enhance phagosomal maturation and xenophagy (64), while
for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium they enhance

pathogens is not established. They can enhance neutrophil and

inhibit phagocytosis and microbicidal responses in other models
such as Fcγ-receptor mediated uptake of opsonized S. aureus
(67) and reduce bacterial killing by neutrophils in a murine
pneumonia model (87). Therefore, how they would be best
used requires further elucidation, as reﬂected in contradictory
ﬁndings from
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
clinical studies. For example, a reduced risk of
community-acquired S. aureus bacteremia (88) and reduced
mortality in pneumonia were reported (89, 90) yet no reduction
in mortality was observed in another pneumonia study (91) or in
a study of ventilator-associated pneumonia (92).

CHALLENGES

Recalibrating responses will
likely require a personalized
medicine approach. Individual pathogens would need varying
degrees of engagement of a given response. S. aureus inhibits
apoptosis-associated
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
killing in macrophages so might need
a greater degree of enhancement, or might
require an
alternative approach, while for S. pneumoniae in which
apoptosis-associated killing is already engaged, the adjustment
in a
might only need to be of a more modest extent

in select patient groups

individuals (33). Certain responses might need
subset of
engagement
such as those with
medical comorbidities that adjust the response. Alternatively
these responses might not be suitable for enhancement
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
in
certain groups. For example, patients with COPD might not
be amenable to enhancement of mROS production or might
require reduction in high baseline levels of antioxidants to
enhance this microbicidal response (16). Such personalized
approaches would require validated tests to help calibrate an
individual response.

Another challenge is that where responses need to be
recalibrated it will be important that responses do not over
shoot and result in overproduction of factors that could lead
to
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
tissue injury if there is excessive production of microbicidals
or inﬂammatory cells (30). This is most likely to be prevented
where the responses enhanced are intracellular, generated at high
levels adjacent to bacteria and transient. Responses will require
application of techniques to measure the individuals response
through use of appropriate biomarkers or imaging modalities and
would beneﬁt from approaches that combine these measures with
microdosing experiments and endomicroscopy (the

application
of in vivo microscopy applied through endoscopy to allow optical
biopsy) to test the eﬃcacy of recalibration (93).

CONCLUSIONS

The ineluctable progression of AMR necessitates investigation
of novel strategies for treating bacterial disease. Based on the
observation that exposure to potentially pathogenic bacteria
infrequently leads to disease, we contend that identiﬁcation
and exploitation of speciﬁc determinants of host defense
(host-
represents a tractable alternative to
----
Source: fimmu-11-00786.pdf
antimicrobials
based therapy). While there are many potential aspects of
the host response that represent tractable targets,
including
humoral factors (e.g., AMP), epithelial barrier function, and
lymphoid populations, we suggest approaches that promote
pauci-inﬂammatory macrophage and neutrophil microbicidal
responses can improve outcomes. We have highlighted a number
of promising in vitro, animal model, human and pre-clinical
observations that support this viewpoint and provide a roadmap
for

INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in particular to antibiotics, has
placed a huge burden on public health delivery systems. AMR
contributes to treatment failure or prolonged hospitalization
of human patients and the global extent of the issue has
been captured by WHO reports including a deﬁnition of the
priority resistant pathogens (Tacconelli et al., 2013; World
Health Organization [WHO],
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
2017a,b). These include multi-drug
resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, which
combined with its relative ease of isolation and capacity for gene
exchange, makes it an important sentinel organism to understand
the epidemiology of AMR in diﬀerent environments and animal
hosts. AMR is an increasing threat to human and animal life and
this is exacerbated in regions of the globe by inadequate health
facility infrastructures and lower sanitation and hygiene.

Antibiotic
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
accessibility is variable across the planet, for both
economic and legislative reasons. The emergence and spread
of AMR in animals, humans and the environment is extremely
complex and it is very diﬃcult to demonstrate where reduced
use would be most eﬀective in terms of restricting AMR
(Woolhouse et al., 2015). As a consequence, a precautionary
principle is being applied in livestock (O’Neill, 2014), including
legislation, rotational practices, and promotion of the use of
disease preventive
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
measures such as vaccines to reduce the use
of antibiotics, especially those of last resort in the treatment of
human infections. While this must be supported, antibiotics are
critical for the eﬀective treatment of livestock diseases and help
preserve the economic viability of small-scale livestock practices
in many low and middle income countries. As such there is an
argument that “the genie is out of the bottle” and the sporadic
use of 1st and 2nd generation antimicrobials for
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
production
animals to treat infections is critical and is unlikely to impact on
human infection treatments (van Bunnik and Woolhouse, 2017).
Toward this, more information is required about resistance
genes in livestock species and humans in diﬀerent settings
across the globe.

In Zambia, farming at diﬀerent scales is central to the country’s
economy and the livelihoods of many smallholders and their
families and communities. There is limited information from
Zambia on AMR levels in farmed
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
livestock. In one recent study
(Chishimba et al., 2016) just over 20% of E. coli isolates from
chickens surveyed were shown to contain extended-spectrum
β-lactamases (ESBLs) indicating they are a reservoir of important
AMR genes, although the risk of strain and/or gene transfer
to humans is unknown. Our recent work in central Zambia
established that antibiotic use in the dairy sector was relatively
well controlled and phenotypic AMR in bovine E. coli was

statistically associated with
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
prescribing trends, use of introduced
exotic (higher production) breeds, and treatment of lumpy skin
disease but not bacterial mastitis (Mainda et al., 2015). Recent
developments in sequencing have revolutionized the diagnosis
of infectious and non-infectious diseases in public health and,
when applied in the context of AMR, makes it possible to
identify diﬀerent resistance genes and also to generate reﬁned
dissemination genetic maps and study the phylogenetics of the
resistomes of the
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
microorganisms involved (Crofts et al., 2017;
van Bunnik and Woolhouse, 2017; Baker et al., 2018). Here, the
sequencing of E. coli isolates from dairy cattle from over 100
smallholdings/farms within a radius of 120 km around Lusaka
provided an opportunity to analyze the AMR genotypes of the
isolates. During this work, we were informed of a small-scale
study collecting E. coli from human patients presenting with
diarrhea at a referral hospital in Lusaka (University Teaching
Hospital). This
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
allowed a comparison of the frequency and
in
diversity of acquired AMR genes associated with E. coli
the two hosts in this region. This analysis was then extended
to include E. coli genomes from humans available from the
Enterobase (Alikhan et al., 2018) database across from multiple
African countries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Selection and Whole Genome

The cattle isolates were from a previously described study, with
the main sampling from 376 dairy cattle covering 104 farms

in
Lusaka and surrounding areas over a 4-month period in early
2014 (Mainda et al., 2015). A total of 371 E. coli isolates were
tested phenotypically for resistance to a panel of six diﬀerent
antibiotics and 61/371 (16.4%) were positive for resistance to

sampling area so we considered this population of isolates
valid for examining relationships between resistance genes in
cattle and human E. coli isolates in the study area. The human
isolates (n = 79), were collected between December
E. coli
2014 and January 2015 and therefore are concurrent with the
sampling frame for the cattle E. coli isolates (Mainda et al.,

from cattle and 73 genomes of E. coli from humans available
for analysis. Quality control of sequence reads was performed
using the software FASTQC (Andrews and Fast, 2010) and when

In addition, for comparative purposes, genome sequences
from 317 E. coli indicated to have been isolated from humans
on the African continent were downloaded from Enterobase
(Alikhan et al., 2018) and analyzed as for the Zambian cattle
and human isolate sequences in this study. The downloaded
sequences were from 15 countries, including Somalia, Egypt,

The isolates relating to these genomes were collected over a
much wider timeframe, from 1973 to 2017. The project numbers
for these downloaded genomes are provided as Supplementary

The three sets of genomes in this study were then analyzed
for the presence and absence of

genes were initially detected using the Short Read Sequence
Type 2 (SRST2) software in a Linux environment (Inouye
et al., 2014) but all analyses published here were carried out
with outputs obtained for AMR genes within the ResFinder
3.0 database (Zankari et al., 2012). This version of
the
database included horizontally acquired resistance genes and not
resistance conferred by mutations, for example in housekeeping
genes. In the current study, acquired AMR

Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
genes were analyzed
in the context of diﬀerent E. coli phylogroups (Clermont et al.,
2015) as E. coli has been traditionally clustered by phylogroup
and these groupings have a good association with isolates
being a commensal or pathogen. The phylotyping method
described by Clermont et al. (2013) was performed in silico.
In short, based on the presence or absence of 4 genes: chuA,
yjaA, tspE4.C2, arpA isolates initially can be separated into 4
phylogroups (A, B1, B2, D). To further distinguish

groups and assign strains to an additional 4 phylogroups (C,
E, F, and cryptic clades) it
is necessary to check for the
presence of a ﬁfth gene trpA and/or distinguish the speciﬁc
alleles for the above genes. The workﬂow is as published
(Clermont et al., 2013). The identiﬁcation of the genes and
genetic fragments in the isolate genomes was carried out with

deﬁned as 98 and 99%, respectively. After performing all the

RESULTS

Diversity of AMR Genotypes in the
Studied E. coli Genomes
Cattle Isolates
As described in the Section “Materials and Methods,” a total
of 224 E. coli whole genome sequences from cattle were
analyzed, which included 61 isolates with established phenotypic
resistances to capture resistance gene diversity from our initial
pool of 371 cattle isolates (Supplementary Data Sheet S1;
Mainda et al., 2015). One phenotypically resistant
isolate
produced poor quality reads and so was not

included. Resistance
genes were detected in 66/224 (29.5%) of the genomes, with 51/60
of these from the phenotypically resistant subset. There were 9/60
isolates that were resistant to the antibiotics tested but for which
no resistance gene was detected. The six most common resistance
genes detected were: strB1 (19%), sul2 (17%), tetA (16%), strA4
(13%) blaTEM−1(13%), and tetB (10%). A detailed list of the

comparison where possible with the cattle isolates is presented as
Supplementary Data Sheet S1. Where the same antibiotics were
tested in both host groups (ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin,
isolates
ciproﬂoxacin, and cefpodoxime) the human E. coli

had signiﬁcantly higher proportions of resistance than the
cattle isolates (p < 0.0001) for each one (Supplementary
Data Sheet S5). Resistance genes were identiﬁed in 62/73
(84.9%) of the E. coli genomes

from humans, although all
human isolates had some level of phenotypic resistance to
the antibiotics tested. The frequency and
one or more of
combinations of resistance genes were then analyzed as for the
cattle isolates. The six most common resistance genes were: sul2
(66%), strB1 (64%), strA4 (57%), blaTEM−1 (56%), aadA (38%),
and tetA (32%): gene patterns and frequencies are shown in
Supplementary Data Sheet S5.

This was then compared with resistance genes present in
317 human isolates

submitted to Enterobase that were from the
African continent. From these 237/317 (74.8%) had at least one
resistance gene and the patterns plus frequencies are shown in
Supplementary Data Sheet S6. The numbers and percentages of
isolates with 0, 1–5, 6–10, and >10 resistance genes are plotted
in Figure 1 (Zambian Human–ZB and African Human–AH).
Despite the sub-sampling bias for WGS toward phenotypically
resistant cattle E. coli isolates, the carriage of multiple AMR
genes was signiﬁcantly

Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
higher in E. coli populations from humans
(Zambian or African) than in isolates of dairy cattle origin
(p < 0.001) (Figure 2). The human isolates were therefore much
more likely to encode multiple resistance genes.

important for clinical and molecular epidemiology and to guide
antibiotic treatment in a region. In the genomes of E. coli

from the sampled Zambian dairy cattle, there were 42 diﬀerent
resistance genotype patterns (Supplementary Data Sheet S4)
compared with 52 in the Lusaka human isolates (Supplementary
Data Sheet S5) and 138 in the wider African human E. coli
isolates (Supplementary Data Sheet S6). Most of these patterns
were not repeated showing the diversity of AMR genotypes
captured in this analysis. The most common positive or negative
co-associations for resistance genes are shown for the

cattle and Zambian human groups (Figures 4A,B). There were 58
paired co-associations in the Zambian human isolates compared
with 14 in the bovine isolates with only 3 being shared between
the two groups, these were: blaTEM-1B with strB; blaTEM-1B
with dfrA8; strA with strB. This analysis demonstrates the distinct

strains that encode multiple resistance

Phylogenomic Assessment of the
Resistome of E. coli Isolated From Cattle
and Humans
The genomes from the two Zambian groups were clustered
according to single nucleotide polymorphisms in core genes

(Figure 5). The genomes from the Zambian human E. coli isolates
tended to cluster together often away from those of cattle origin
and this in part reﬂects diﬀerences in phylogroups between
the two Zambian sample sets (Figure 6). The distribution and
number of acquired resistance genes were
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
then plotted on to the
relationship tree and this provides a clear visual representation of
the multiple resistance genes in the Zambian human compared
to the bovine E. coli isolates (Figure 5). The majority of cattle
E. coli with resistance genes were assigned to phylogroup B1
indicating that these isolates were largely commensals (Figure 6).
However, the isolates with multiple AMR resistance genes from
the Zambian human isolates were distributed across the major
phylogroups including those
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
associated with more pathogenic
strains (Phylogroups B2 and D). The human strains originating
from across Africa followed a similar trend to the group of
Zambian human isolates although no phylogroup D strains
were detected. It is striking that the bovine E. coli isolates
in phylogroups associated with pathogenesis, B2 and D, had
negligible AMR levels in contrast to the human isolates in these
groups (Figure 6). Conversely, the proportion of isolates with
AMR genes in the “commensal” B1 cluster

Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
was signiﬁcantly
higher for the two sets of sequenced human isolates compared
to the sequenced bovine isolates.

were sequenced here to obtain genomic information in relation
to the acquired resistance genes present. During the study we
were also able to obtain a group of human E. coli isolates selected
from people presenting with diarrhea at a University Teaching
Hospital in Lusaka over the same timeframe (2014). Phenotypic
testing for

resistance demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher levels of
resistance amongst the human isolates when the same antibiotics
were tested (Supplementary Data Sheet S1). Sequencing of

these isolates then provided an opportunity to compare the type
and distribution of acquired resistance genes in E. coli isolates
originating from the two hosts. While we appreciate the caveats of
such an analysis, especially the relatively small number of human
isolates and their post hoc addition, we consider the

also included comparison with 317 E. coli genomes isolated from

provided similar results to the Zambian human cohort which we
consider as a validation of this study.

be reasonable to expect that the human cohort may contain a
higher proportion of potentially pathogenic E. coli compared
to the cattle set. This was apparent from an analysis of the
phylogroups of the isolates (Figure 6) with, in fact, both human
cohorts containing higher proportions of phylogroups associated
with pathogenic strains (B2 and/or D) when compared with the
cattle isolates which were predominately

phylogroup B1, more
associated with a commensal existence. While we do not have the
antimicrobial treatment data for the Zambian human isolates we
would anticipate that we are still capturing many isolates in these
groups that are not associated with disease.

Despite the pre-selection of all phenotypically resistant isolates
for sequencing in the cattle set it was evident that resistance
genes were signiﬁcantly more frequent in the E. coli isolates
from the Zambian human population compared to
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
E. coli
isolates from local dairy cattle. The majority of human isolates
encoded resistance genes in stark contrast to the cattle isolates

and the human isolates carried a signiﬁcantly higher mean
number of resistance genes than the cattle isolates (Figure 1).
As a consequence, E. coli
isolates encoding multiple drug
resistance were much more common in the human cohort.
The human isolates also had a signiﬁcantly higher frequency of
acquired AMR genes compared to the cattle isolates even
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
when
considering those assigned only to phylogroup B1, generally

There has been considerable debate over the emergence
of AMR in humans that may be linked to antibiotic use in
production animals (Goodyear, 2002; Gillings, 2013; O’Neill,
2014; Woolhouse et al., 2015; van Bunnik and Woolhouse, 2017).
Whilst this study covers only one area of one country, it is evident
from our ﬁndings that the resistance genotypes present in the
human isolates were much

coli of human origin that were absent
in the E. coli of cattle origin. However, the resistance genes
encoding older and commonly applied antibiotics such as tetA
and tetB for tetracycline, strA and strB for streptomycin, sul1
and sul2 for sulphonamides and dfrA for trimethoprim were
detected in both populations, which is an indication that such
resistances are common. However, such selection could still
be driven by independent pressures in each population rather
than cross-over between them.
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
It is also useful evidence that
certain clinically important antibiotics such as cephalosporins
and ﬂuoroquinolones are still being mostly used in the
treatment of human infection and rarely used in dairy cattle
of the study area. This could be attributed to the high cost
of such antibiotics when compared to the ﬁrst generation
antibiotics (tetracycline, penicillin, and sulphonamides) which
are less expensive and the ones commonly used in cattle
(Mainda et al., 2015). Further, the human hosts
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
were likely
to have been treated with diﬀerent
types of antibiotics
than the cattle host as shown by the wide diversity of
resistance genes.
A recent

study that examined antibiotic resistance in
atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli from both sub-Saharan
Africa and Asia (Ingle et al., 2018) indicated high levels of
AMR in these human isolates concordant with our study.
In particular they noted certain co-associations, particularly
of strA and strB with sul2, with blaTEM and dfrA14
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
being
linked in a further subset. These associations match those
shown to be prevalent in our study in both cattle and human
isolates and probably indicate the longer term evolution of
combined resistances to antibiotics that have been applied over
longer timeframes.

More studies need to be carried out

to analyze the
distribution of strains and resistance genes in species that
are in physical co-association as even in the context of
E. coli we are still trying to determine if AMR transfer
----
Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
is
primarily one of strain acquisition and strain maintenance
in that host or, perhaps more likely, temporary transmission
to a new host and then dissemination of the AMR gene(s)
to a more host-adapted strain. This dynamic will vary
depending on the bacterial species being investigated, but
species that we know can be promiscuous and zoonotic, such
as E. coli, are a logical point of study until metagenome
sequencing costs allow a wider picture of AMR dynamics
in complex populations to be

Source: fmicb-10-01114.pdf
gathered. Even then, better
methods need to be developed to associate AMR genes with the
carrying organism.

The limited sharing of strains and resistance genes between
the dairy cattle and human populations in the study area
and sampling interval serves as an important reminder of the
challenge of establishing transmission routes, and of attributing
the AMR problem in humans to antibiotics use in farmed
animals. As genome sequence data accrue it should be feasible
to understand the direction,

to indicate exchange of combined AMR genes between the two
hosts or sharing of speciﬁc resistant strains. However, many
AMR genes are present on highly mobilizable genetic elements
including plasmids (Woolhouse et al., 2015) so ready exchange
of these to generate diﬀerent AMR combinations in diﬀerent
strains can occur and the original sources of such genes is
virtually impossible to deﬁne. Beyond this and a study in poultry
in Zambia (Chishimba et al., 2016) the signiﬁcance of

other
reservoirs of AMR in the region have not been investigated. In
addition, while we have collected data on the types of antibiotics
used in the cattle population (Mainda et al., 2015), we do
not have equivalent data for other production systems and the
human population in Lusaka and so the selection pressures in
these communities on AMR by antibiotic use are not deﬁned
(Mshana et al., 2013).

lethal.
Current drugs for HAT are difﬁcult to administer
and have severe side effects. Together with in-
creasing drug resistance this results in urgent need
for new treatments. T. brucei and other trypanoso-
matid pathogens require a distinct form of post-
transcriptional mRNA modiﬁcation for mitochondrial
gene expression. A multi-protein complex called the
editosome cleaves mitochondrial mRNA, inserts or
deletes uridine nucleotides at speciﬁc positions and
re-ligates the mRNA. RNA editing

ligase 1 (REL1) is
essential for the re-ligation step and has no close ho-
molog in the mammalian host, making it a promising
target for drug discovery. However, traditional assays
for RELs use radioactive substrates coupled with
gel analysis and are not suitable for high-throughput
screening of compound libraries. Here we describe
a ﬂuorescence-based REL activity assay. This as-
say is compatible with a 384-well microplate format
and sensitive, satisﬁes statistical criteria for
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
high-
throughput methods and is readily adaptable for
other polynucleotide ligases. We validated the as-
say by determining kinetic properties of REL1 and

by identifying REL1 inhibitors in a library of small,
pharmacologically active compounds.

INTRODUCTION

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as
sleeping sickness, currently affects an estimated 30 000–
50 000 people and threatens millions more (1,2). Despite
a decreasing number of new infections over the last years,
HAT still has
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
a major impact on health and economy of
sub-Saharan Africa. A similar decline in cases in the 1960s
was followed by re-emergence due to a collapse in surveil-
lance and control activities (3). Additionally to the direct
threat to human health, Trypanosoma spp. have a heavy im-
pact on local economies by infecting livestock like cattle or
pigs. The occurrence of resistant strains in humans has been
reported but their distribution and frequency are unclear
(4). Together, these problems illustrate
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
the urgent need for
new medication. HAT itself progresses in two stages, with
the parasite Trypanosoma brucei proliferating in the host’s
blood and lymph during the first phase, making the para-
sites relatively accessible for drugs. However, phase I usually
only shows unspecific symptoms like headache or fever and,
if untreated, the disease progresses to phase II. Here the par-
asite enters the central nervous system (3,5). This results in
various symptoms like coordination disabilities,
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
confusion
and disturbances in sleep cycle which gave rise to the com-
mon name sleeping sickness. Left untreated HAT is almost
always fatal (6).

Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite from the
order Kinetoplastida, infecting humans as well as many

mammals (7,8). One of the most remarkable characteris-
tics of kinetoplastids is the unusual organization of their
mitochondrial genome, the eponymous kinetoplast (9). Mi-
tochondrial proteins are encoded by a few dozen presum-
ably identical maxicircles of
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
∼23 kbp. In addition, the kine-
toplast also contains thousands of minicircles, each ∼1 kbp
in size, encoding so called guide RNAs (gRNAs). These 50–
60 nt transcripts are essential for the expression of mito-
chondrial genes by RNA editing, directing the process by
virtue of their complementarity to fully edited mRNA (10).
Three distinct protein complexes of ∼20S, called core edi-
tosomes (or RNA editing core complexes), modify the pre-
mRNA by insertion or deletion of uridine-nucleotides
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
(11–
14). However, auxiliary complexes are required for gRNA
processing and binding, and the editing process is integrated
into other RNA processing mechanism, resulting in a highly
complex network of interactions (14,15). A single gRNA
can code for several insertions or deletions, but in most
cases editing involves sequential action of several overlap-
ping gRNAs. During editing the pre-mRNA is cut by an
endonuclease, uridine nucleosides are inserted by a terminal
uridylyl transferase (TUTase)
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
or removed by an ExoUase,
and finally the edited mRNA strand is re-ligated by an
RNA ligase. Investigation of function and composition of
the editosomes has shown that they contain two different
trimeric subcomplexes. The first subcomplex contains struc-
tural protein KREPA2 (a.k.a. MP63), ExoUase REX2 and
RNA editing ligase 1 (REL1), the second subcomplex con-
tains structural protein KREPA1 (a.k.a. MP81), TUTase
RET2 and RNA editing ligase 2 (REL2) (13,16). The struc-
tural proteins directly
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
interact with the enzymes and bind
them to the complex (17). While REL1 function is essential
for T. brucei survival, no negative effect has been observed
after REL2 RNAi-mediated knockdown (18–21), and the
precise functions of the two RELs in uridine insertion and
deletion editing remain to be clarified (14,21,22).

The RELs belong to the superfamily of polynucleotide
ligases which also includes DNA ligases and other RNA
ligases. This relationship is strongly supported by se-
quence comparison
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
and structural investigations (23,24).
All polynucleotide ligases share five conserved motifs (I, III,
IIIa, IV, V) in their catalytic domain which form the active
site and binding pocket for the cofactor adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) or NAD+ (25). Members of this family employ
a three-step reaction mechanism. The first step is adenylyla-
tion of a 100% conserved lysine residue by use of the ATP or
NAD+ in the binding pocket. The second step is the transfer
of AMP onto the 5(cid:4) end of the
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
donor (3(cid:4)) substrate RNA or
DNA to yield a high-energy 5(cid:4)-5(cid:4) pyrophosphate intermedi-
ate. In the third step the ligation of donor and acceptor (5(cid:4))
RNA or DNA takes place and AMP is released.

The essential nature of REL1, the absence of a close
homolog in the host and the availability of a high reso-
lution crystal structure of its N-terminal catalytic domain
(26) make it a very interesting target for drug development
(18). As an important step toward this goal we have
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
now
developed a novel activity assay for REL1 that uses flu-
orophore labeled substrate RNA and is compatible with
high-throughput screening (HTS) methods for the identifi-
cation of small molecule inhibitors. Traditional REL1 activ-
ity assays utilize the incorporation of radioactively labeled

ATP into the ligase or the ligation of pre-cleaved radioac-
tively labeled RNA; both assays require gel electrophoresis
(27). This makes these assays relatively complicated, expen-
sive, time consuming
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
and not amenable for high-throughput
methods. HTS-compatible, fluorescence based assays have
been described for DNA ligases (28–31) and for full-round
trypanosome RNA editing (32,33), but not for RNA ligases.
To test the potential of our assay we used it to screen the
Library Of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (LOPAC,
Sigma-Aldrich) for REL1 inhibitors. We confirmed activity
of five of the top six hits in individual assays and assessed
the potential binding mode of one confirmed hit, the

trypanosomatid drug suramin, by modeling the interaction
with REL1 and applying molecular dynamics simulations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Protein production and purification

Trypanosoma brucei REL1 (systematic TriTrypDB ID
Tb927.9.4360; www.tritrypdb.org) was produced recombi-
nantly in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The REL1 ex-
pression construct, a generous gift from Wim Hol, Junpeng
Deng and Meiting Wu (University of Washington, Seat-
tle), was generated as follows. The sequence

encoding REL1
amino acids 51–469 (corresponding to the mature polypep-
tide without the mitochondrial targeting signal) was cloned
into pET-21d (Novagen). Additionally the sequence for a
6xHis-tag followed by a linker and amino acids 56–176 from
KREPA2 (systematic TriTrypDB ID Tb927.10.8210), cor-
responding to the region directly interacting with REL1
(17), was cloned into the same vector downstream of the
REL1 coding sequence. Competent BL21 (DE3) cells were
transformed with this

polycistronic construct and grown at
37◦C to an OD of ∼0.4. Expression was induced with 0.1–
0.5 mM IPTG and performed at 20◦C for 20 h. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended
in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glyc-
erol, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF and 1 mM benzamidine,
supplied with Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor. Cells
were lysed with a TS Series Benchtop cell disruptor (Con-
stant Systems Ltd.) and the lysate centrifuged at 50 000 g
for 1 h. The

supernatant was passed through a 0.2 (cid:2)m fil-
ter and applied to a HiTrap FF IMAC (GE Healthcare)
charged with Ni2+. After a wash step with 40 mM imida-
zole, protein was eluted with a linear 40–500 mM imida-
zole gradient. Elution fractions were analyzed by sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) and suitable fractions were pooled. Protein was then
concentrated to 10 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80◦C.

NSC-42067 served as positive control for inhibition (34).
As additional controls, each plate included reactions with-

a minimum incubation period of 15 min plates were
read using a ratiometric wavelength read (excitation at 485
nm, detection at 665 and 535 nm). HTS was carried out at
The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA, USA.

used to separate the RNA molecules by non-denaturing

Protein docking and modeling

The first model of suramin bound simultaneously to the ac-
tive sites of two REL1 enzymes was built manually using
Maestro from Schr ¨odinger (35). Initially, half of suramin,
which is symmetrical, was modeled into the active site of
the REL1 crystal structure (26). Structural water molecules
were deleted prior to this step to allow positioning of the
ligand. The resulting complex was minimized to optimize
enzyme-ligand interactions. Subsequently, a
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
copy was made
of that complex, which was then reflected in the symme-
try point of suramin. The two halves of suramin were sub-
sequently bonded. To generate subsequent models, single
bonds in suramin were rotated while the enzymes with re-
spect to the ligand were fixed; this forced a rigid body ro-
tation of the enzymes with respect to one another to find
allowed conformations where the enzymes did not clash.
To evaluate the stability of both the ligand binding mode
and the proteins adjacent

to each other, molecular dynam-
ics simulations of the complexes were carried out (further
details can be found in the Supplementary Data).

RESULTS

Protein production and purification

We were unable to obtain soluble, full-length REL1 when
expressed on its own in E. coli. However, a di-cistronic
construct for co-expression of REL1 with a fragment of
KREPA2 (amino acid residues 56–176; plasmid generously
provided by Wim Hol, University of Washington), permit-
ted expression of soluble REL1.
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
This region of KREPA2
interacts with the C-terminal domain of the ligase (17,36)
and probably supports its correct folding in E. coli. Recom-
binant protein expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using LB
medium resulted in an initial ratio of roughly 2:1 of insol-
uble to soluble protein (estimated from relative band in-
tensity on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels). Reducing
IPTG concentration from 0.5 mM to 0.1 mM and adding a
10 min heat shock at 42◦C directly before induction resulted
in an
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
optimized ratio of ∼1:1 and an increased yield of solu-
ble REL1-KREPA256–176 protein complex. Using a 6xHis-
tag at the N-terminus of KREPA256–176 for IMAC purifi-
cation, the REL1-KREPA256–176 complex could be isolated
to >95% purity (Figure 1A).

dsRNA results in FRET. After sealing of the nick (e.g.
by active REL1), the FRET signal will be unaffected by
dsRNA denaturation (Figure 1B). Preventing sealing of the
nick (e.g. by inhibition of REL1 activity) will result in loss
of the FRET signal after dsRNA denaturation. As shown
in Figure 1C and D, the FRET signal shows the expected
dependency on REL1, ATP and gRNA. Reactions without
exogenous

ATP gave a slightly higher signal than reactions
without REL1 (Figure 1C). This has previously been ob-
served for editosomes purified from T. brucei (37,38) as well
as for recombinant phage RNA ligase T4Rnl2 (24,39)––the
closest known homolog of the RELs (26)––and is due to
some ligase being pre-adenylylated when isolated from cells.

The dependence on gRNA is consistent with earlier re-
ports that unbridged RNA molecules are poor substrates
for the RELs (37,38). Efficient denaturation was
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
achieved
by incubating the samples at 96◦C in the presence of 200-
fold excess of a DNA oligo that is complimentary to the
gRNA. This reduced the signal of unligated RNAs to that
of control reactions without both gRNA and REL1 (Figure
1D, compare heat denatured ‘−REL, +gRNA’ to ‘−REL1,
−gRNA’). Gel electrophoresis confirmed generation of the
expected products after annealing of the synthetic RNA
substrates and incubation with REL1 (Supplementary Fig-
ures S1 and S2). For both fluorophores, two

alternative at-
tachment sites were also tested (6-FAM attached to the first

uridylyl on the 5(cid:4)-RNA and Cy5 attached to the third uridy-
lyl on the 3(cid:4)-RNA, compare to Figure 1B; the attachment
chemistry limited the possible attachment sites to uridy-
lyls). The RNA molecules were tested in all four combina-
tions. The combination shown in Figure 1B gave an at least
three-fold better signal-to-baseline ratio (S:B;
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
baseline de-
fined as reaction without ligase) than the other combina-
tions (data not shown) and was used for further optimiza-
tions. Replacing 6-FAM with Cy3 as donor resulted in an
approximately five-fold drop in S:B (Supplementary Figure
S3A and B). Consequently, subsequent optimizations were
performed using the 6-FAM/Cy5 combination (excitation
at 490 nm, detection at 670 nm). Note that the binding ki-
netics for unlabeled or fluorophore-labeled RNA substrates
to REL1 were not determined.
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
It is possible that the fluo-
rophores affect binding to REL1, for example by steric hin-
drance, and such effects may in part be responsible for the
differences in S:B ratios observed for the various combina-
tions tested above.

To determine suitable temperatures for the ligation reac-
tion a range from 12.0–40.5◦C was tested. As shown in Fig-
ure 2A, 22◦C and 27◦C resulted in the strongest FRET sig-
nals, with higher temperatures possibly decreasing enzyme
and/or substrate stability. Testing

a pH range of HEPES
and Tris–HCl buffers for the ligation reaction showed that
Tris–HCl pH 6.0 gave the best S:B ratio (Supplementary
Figure S3C, Figure 2B). Similar experiments using differ-
ent buffers and pH values for the RNA annealing reaction
showed that Tris–HCl buffer with pH 8.0 resulted in the best
S:B ratio (Figure 2C; note that the resulting pH in the liga-
tion reaction is 7.0). Several additional buffer components
were tested to enhance ligation efficiency. Of the Mg2+ and
K+

Source: gkv938.pdf
concentrations tested, 50 mM Mg2+ and 250 mM K+ in
the 10× annealing buffer and 10 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM K+
in the 10× ligation buffer were optimal (data not shown).
The presence of six cysteines in the REL1–KREPA256–176
complex, four in REL1 and two in KREPA256–176, makes
formation of disulphide bonds a possible way of protein
denaturation. Accordingly, 2.5 mM DTT was used during
purification and in all activity assays. However, since 2-
mercaptoethanol (2-ME) has a longer half-life than DTT
(40)
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
it was tested as an alternative reducing agent. Initial ex-
periments with pre-ligated FRET substrate indicated that
2-ME had no negative effect on the FRET signal (data
not shown). However, independently of buffer or pH, 0.2%
(v/v) 2-ME resulted in a much lower S:B ratio after the lig-
ation reaction compared to 2.5 mM DTT (Figure 2D). It
is possible that the smaller 2-ME can enter the REL1 ATP
binding pocket and modify a cysteine involved in forming
the active center (26), thereby altering
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
the affinity and ac-
tivity of REL1. The larger DTT would not be able to enter
the binding pocket.

The presence of detergents in the assay proved bene-
ficial. A final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100
improved the S:B ratio and resulted in faster reaction ki-
netics (Figure 3A). Titration of Triton X-100 and Brij-35
showed that a combination of 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and
0.003% (w/v) Brij-35 gave the best results (data not shown).
The small amount of detergents might stabilize REL1

or
KREPA256–176 by increasing protein solubility, reduce pro-

tein binding to the well surface and/or help release ligated
RNA product from REL1.

In our assay, distinguishing ligated from un-ligated sub-
strate with good sensitivity and specificity depends upon a
complete separation of the fluorophore-labeled RNAs from
the gRNA bridge at the end of the reaction. Heat denatu-
ration at 96◦C in the presence of excess competitor DNA
(complementary to gRNA) proved efficient in small

experiments (see Figure 1D). However, this method is not
ideal for an HTS setting. Therefore, urea concentrations be-
tween 1 M and 8 M were tested as a method for efficient
denaturation at room temperature. Concentrations of 4 M
urea or higher denatured RNA duplexes as effectively as in-
cubation at 96◦C (Figure 3B). The assay was not affected
by the presence of up to 5% (v/v) DMSO (Figure 3C), an
important condition for HTS where compounds are usually
available in this solvent. Only
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
concentrations ≥ 10% (v/v)
DMSO resulted in a noticeable decrease of the FRET sig-
nal.

Characterization of REL1 reaction kinetics using the FRET
assay

Using the optimized conditions we next measured product
formation over time and over a range of REL1 concen-
trations (Figure 4A). As expected, product formation in-
creased with higher protein concentration as well as longer
incubation times. For 66 nM REL1, the maximum signal
was reached after 20 min. Calibration with a double
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
6-
FAM/Cy5-labeled control oligonucleotide determined that
the maximum signal corresponded to ligation of ∼95%
of substrate (Supplementary Figure S3D). Reactions with
lower REL1 concentrations did not reach the same max-
imum. Adding fresh ATP restarted the reaction (Supple-
mentary Figure S3E), suggesting that this observation was
not simply a consequence of deteriorating activity of the en-
zyme. The biochemical basis for this observation remains
to be investigated. Testing product formation

sumption of Michaelis–Menten kinetics using a range of
ATP concentrations and initial velocity conditions (up to

substrate ATP of 0.76 ± 0.27 (cid:2)M, 42.0 ± 4.0 nM/min and
0.54 ± 0.04 min−1, respectively (Figure 4B). The specific ac-
tivity of the REL1 preparation under these reaction condi-
tions was therefore 16.8 nmol min−1 mg−1 (50 ng of protein
was used per assay volume of 20 (cid:2)l); this value was similar
for other

preparations. We caution that the kinetic parame-
ters were calculated under the assumption that 100% of the
enzyme in the preparation was active. The actual percentage
of active protein has not been determined.

Pilot HTS and identification of REL1 inhibitors

To validate the suitability of the FRET-based REL1 activ-
ity assay for HTS, the assay conditions were adapted to 384-
well format to facilitate a pilot screen. An ATP concentra-
tion of 10 (cid:2)M was chosen as a compromise between

tivity to inhibition and robust S:B ratio. As positive control
for inhibition we used National Cancer Institute compound
NSC42067, which had previously been identified in a virtual
screen and experimentally confirmed as a REL1 inhibitor

plementary Figure S4). Screening the LOPAC 1280 library
(single shot assays at 10 (cid:2)M final concentration; four 384-
well plates, including controls) resulted in a mean Z’ score
of 0.74 and a mean S:B of 2.3, confirming suitability for
HTS (41). Applying the standard hit cut-off of three stan-
dard deviations from control samples resulted in the iden-
tification of 30 initial ‘hits’ (2.4% hit rate). Eight of these
were not

reproducible, resulting in a final hit list of 22 com-
pounds (Table 1). Six of the seven compounds that showed
the strongest inhibition in the single-shot screen (Supple-
mentary Figure S5) were analyzed by dose response curves
to determine IC50 values. The compounds myricetin, tyr-
phostin AG 537, suramin, NF 023 hydrate and aurothioglu-
cose could be confirmed as inhibitors with IC50 values in the
low (cid:2)M range, while the initial hit methyl-3,4-dephostatin
showed no significant

inhibition up to 50 (cid:2)M concentra-
tion (Figure 5 and Table 1). A second pilot screen against

the Maybridge library with a slightly altered liquid handling
protocol (pre-dispensing 25 (cid:2)l of enzyme dilution to each
of the first two well of the plate) resulted in improved HTS
statistics of an average Z’ of 0.88 and an S:B of 3.6 (Supple-
mentary Figure S6). The standard cut-off of three standard
deviations from control samples resulted in a 3.3% hit rate.
An additional reading before
----

stopping the reaction allowed
elimination of compounds interfering with the FRET signal
and reduced the hit rate to <1%.

Modeling suramin into the REL1 active site

Suramin’s relatively high potency combined with its large
size and symmetric character suggested that it might be
able to bind two instances of REL1 simultaneously. In-
deed, simultaneous binding of this compound to two target
molecules has been shown for Leishmania mexicana pyru-
vate kinase (LmPYK) (42). Therefore we explored

plex we took advantage of the symmetry in suramin and
first modeled binding of the one half to a single REL1 en-
zyme using the crystal structure with ATP bound (26). Half
of suramin was placed in the active site of REL1 overlay-
ing the naphthalene moiety of suramin with that of ATP
as best possible––given the bulky sulfonate groups––while
avoiding steric clashes. The complex was then duplicated
and reflected in

the symmetry point of suramin shown in
Figure 6A. The binding mode of suramin is very similar
to other sulfonated naphthalene inhibitors, V2–V4, that we
have previously discovered (34) and the naphthalene ring’s
position is very similar to that of the native ATP substrate,
also stacking with Phe209 (Figure 6B; see Supplementary
Data for further details of the binding mode). Differences
are likely due to suramin containing three bulky sulfonate
groups while the other naphthalenes contained only

one or
two of these. Exploring different orientations of the two en-
zyme molecules by rigid-body rotation we found three ad-
ditional models, during the rotation where the enzymes did
not clash. To gauge whether the four models were stable,
we subjected each of them to 100 ns of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. The enzymes are independently very sta-
ble over the course of the simulations (Supplementary Fig-
ure S7), the protein–ligand interactions are stable, and the
water phase between
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
the two enzymes is persistent through-
out each of the simulations. This latter part suggests that
the two enzymes do not collapse on each other as a result
of suramin binding, which is in part perhaps because the
length of suramin prevents the two proteins from clashing.
The salt-bridge between Glu60 and Arg111, which was pre-
viously reported to be dynamic during simulations (34,43),
shows similar behavior here; the interaction is broken and
intermittently formed during the simulation of some
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
of the
models, in other models it is more stable, perhaps attributed
to Glu60’s interacting with an amine group of suramin. The
models suggest that suramin binding to two proteins is a
likely outcome and contributes to its relatively high potency.
The binding mode we modeled for suramin is also likely for

DISCUSSION

The key editing enzyme REL1 has been validated as an es-
sential enzyme in the disease-causing bloodstream form of
T. brucei (18), but lack of a specific, HTS compatible ac-
tivity assay has hampered development of REL1 as a tar-
get for novel therapies. We have now developed a novel
FRET-based assay for REL1 that combines ease of use with
highly reliable and reproducible results, thus demonstrating
its suitability for HTS. Together with available HTS assays
that can
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
monitor a complete cycle of editing in vitro (32,33),
this assay makes the unique RNA editing process in try-
panosomatid parasites accessible as a new target for ther-
apeutic intervention.

Several aspects of this assay have systematically been op-
timized for the use in drug discovery. For example, the use of
urea instead of heat for denaturation reduces handling time
and eliminates the need for a suitable method of heating.
One major advantage of the FRET-based assay is the di-
rect
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
measurement of the ligated RNA product itself. Avoid-
ing indirect measurement through secondary products elim-
inates possible sources for errors. Using only labeled RNA
substrate enables detection of every ligated RNA strand,
dramatically increasing the S:B ratio. Given enough time
and sufficient protein concentration, almost all of the sup-
plied substrate is ligated, which increases the S:B ratio fur-
ther. Combined, these aspects result in robust screening
statistics and biologically

meaningful hit identification: five
of the six hits that were selected for follow-up could be con-
firmed. The absence of sample heating, the easy execution
due to the low number of steps and components and the
low volume needed compare favorably to assays described
for DNA ligases (28–31).

Although the principal motivation for screening the
LOPAC library was to validate our assay for HTS purposes,

the hits that were confirmed as REL1 inhibitors (suramin,
NF 023, myricetin, tyrphostin AG 537, aurothioglucose)
may prove useful. Suramin has been used for treatment of
HAT since the 1920s. Most likely it acts on several T. brucei
pathways and the exact mode of action is still not

entirely
clear (42,44,45). Suramin and its analogue NF 023 have pre-
viously been identified as inhibitor of RNA editing in vitro
(32,46). One study suggested that NF 023 and suramin ‘are
either acting at a step following the endonuclease cleavage
or alternatively having global effects on the editing complex’
(32). Our confirmation of these compounds as REL1 in-
hibitors supports the first hypothesis. Interestingly, our labs
had previously identified related naphthalene-based com-

pounds
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
similar to suramin and NF 023 as REL1 inhibitors
via virtual screens (34,43). However, since trypanosomes
that are not dependent on mitochondrial gene expression
show no decreased sensitivity to suramin (47), REL1 is
clearly not a relevant target of suramin in vivo. Further-
more, negatively charged compounds would require active
transport to reach suitable concentrations in the mitochon-
drial matrix, which is also negatively charged. Both suramin
and NF 023 have also been found to inhibit HCV

zyme (48). Crystal structures of suramin and suramin ana-

Trypanosoma cruzi showed how suramin binds these pro-
teins (42). Our molecular modeling studies suggest a similar
two-to-one stoichiometry for REL1-suramin binding, and
perhaps for NF 023 as well.

Two other hits from the LOPAC screen, myricetin
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
and
tyrphostin AG 537, share as a common feature phenyl
groups with two or one additional hydroxyl groups, respec-
tively, and this similarity could be a possible reason for
the considerable potency of both molecules toward REL1.
Nonetheless, they belong to different compound classes.
Tyrphostin AG 537, like other dimeric tyrphostins, is a po-
tent inhibitor of the oncoprotein EGF receptor tyrosine ki-
nase (49) and of dynamin I GTPase activity (50). Its rel-
atively high molecular weight makes
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
it an unlikely candi-
date for hit-to-lead optimization. Myricetin is a naturally
occurring flavonol with strong antiradical activity and an-
tiproliferative effects on cancer lines, reportedly due to an
impairment of cell cycle progression (51). It was also iden-
tified as an inhibitor of T. brucei hexokinase 1, albeit with
only moderate potency (52). A closely related compound,
quercertin, is toxic to T. brucei gambiense in vitro with an
LD50 of 10 (cid:2)M without affecting human hemopoietic
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
cells
(53). These findings, combined with myricetin’s low molecu-
lar weight and considerable potency toward REL1, suggest
myricetin as a possible starting point for compound opti-
mization. These examples illustrate the potential of our as-
say for finding new drug leads for HAT. The unproblematic
adaptation of the assay for 384-well format suggests feasi-
bility for a 1536-well format.

The HTS described here cannot distinguish between
competitive inhibitors of ATP binding (which would be
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
ex-
pected to enter the ATP binding pocket), non-competitive
inhibitors that alter REL1 activity in other ways or com-
pounds that bind the RNA substrates. Compounds that in-
hibit editosome function by one of the latter two mecha-
nisms have been described (54,55). The suramin docking
studies described above and our earlier confirmation of
similar compounds as inhibitors of the adenylylation step
(34), strongly suggest that suramin and, by extension, NF
023, are indeed competitive inhibitors
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
of ATP binding. The
mode of inhibition of the other compounds described in the
present study remains to be determined.

HAT is only one of the diseases caused by kinetoplastids
(56). Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi is endemic to South
America and endangers tens of millions of people there
(57,58). Leishmania spp. cause leishmaniasis which results in
hundreds of thousands of deaths every year (59). All kine-
toplastids have mitochondrial RNA editing ligases highly
homologs to T. brucei REL1
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
(18,26). In the case of T. bru-
cei, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial REL1 with potency in
vivo is required to cross three membranes, which poses ad-
ditional challenges for drug development. However, a num-
ber of important existing anti-trypanosomatid drugs have
mitochondrial targets (47), a huge range of other clinically
approved drugs act directly on these organelles (60), and ap-
proaches are being developed for mitochondrial specific de-
livery (60).

Additionally to the potential for
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
cross-trypanosomatid
drug discovery our assay also has potential as a research
tool for further investigations into REL1 function. This is
particularly relevant for T. cruzi and Leishmania, where ge-

netic tools to study gene function are less developed than in
T. brucei. In vitro and in vivo studies of REL1 biochemistry
and function have traditionally relied on assays with ra-
dioactively labeled substrates (22,26,27,61). Using our new
FRET-based assay drastically reduces the amount of
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
pro-
tein and reagents needed as well as simplifying the process
of activity testing.

Beyond RNA editing ligases this assay has also the poten-
tial to be used with other nucleic acid ligases. The assay for-
mat can readily be adapted to study bacteriophage ligases
such as T4Rnl2 (24,62) and DNA ligases, which are pursued
as potential antimicrobial and anti-cancer targets (29,63).
Adaptation of the assay format to the latter enzymes would
also be useful to determine if REL1 inhibitors
----
Source: gkv938.pdf
interfere with
human DNA ligase functions and thereby estimate possible
side effects early during the drug development process.

In summary, the new RNA ligase activity assay presented
here will aid drug discovery and basic research efforts re-
garding RNA editing in trypanosomes and also promises
to assist the investigation of related nucleic acid processing
activities in other systems.

Abstract

The parasitic salmon louse represents one of the biggest challenges to environmen-

tally sustainable salmonid aquaculture across the globe. This species also displays a 

high evolutionary potential, as
----
Source: group C The potential for cleaner fish-driven evolution in the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis.pdf
demonstrated by its rapid development of resistance 

to delousing chemicals. In response, farms now use a range of non-chemical delousing 

methods, including cleaner fish that eat lice from salmon. Anecdotal reports suggest 

that in regions where cleaner fish are extensively used on farms, lice have begun to 

appear less pigmented and therefore putatively less visible to cleaner fish. However, 

it remains an open question whether these observations reflect a plastic (environ-

mental) or

adaptive (genetic) response. To investigate this, we developed a pigment 

scoring system and conducted complimentary experiments which collectively dem-

onstrate that, a) louse pigmentation is strongly influenced by environmental condi-

tions, most likely light, and b) the presence of modest but significant differences in 

pigmentation between two strains of lice reared under identical conditions. Based on 

these data, we conclude that pigmentation in the salmon louse is strongly

influenced 

by environmental conditions, yet there are also indications of underlying genetic con-

trol. Therefore, lice could display both plastic and adaptive responses to extensive 

cleaner fish usage where visual appearance is likely to influence survival of lice.

was less pigmented than the LsOslofjord strain, (b) lice on the dorsal 

side  of  the  fish  were  more  pigmented  than  those  from  the  ventral

There was also a substantial difference in pigment scores between 

the two louse strains for adult dorsal females (Figure 5a). The dorsal/

ventral difference in subjective pigmentation scores was not evident 

for males.

Based on the modeling

Source: group C The potential for cleaner fish-driven evolution in the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis.pdf
results, sex and population were the most 

influential factors determining pigmentation, as measured by dMGV, 

in this trial. Position on fish was also influential, while length was not 

(Table 5). Interactions between length: sex and sex: position on fish did 

not improve AIC (M19– M21). Thus, M17 was selected as the mini-

dorsal LsOslofjord females 
(dMGV = 67 ± 1.65); the same difference between strains was evi-
dent for females collected from the ventral side of the fish (Figure 5). 

Moreover, ventral females from both strains were lighter than those 

collected from the dorsal side. These patterns were also observed 

for males (Figure 5). dMGV did not change with size in either gen-

der (Figure 6). Females ranged in cephalothorax length from 3.93 to 

4.75 mm, while males ranged from 2.65 to 3.32 mm, and

Unvalidated reports from the field suggest that in regions where 

cleaner fish are used to control louse levels on commercial farms, 

recently,  lice  appear  less  pigmented  and  more  difficult  to  detect 

during lice counting operations than in previous years.

Speculation 

has  then  been  raised  that  such  lice,  with  less  pigmentation,  may 

also be more “invisible” to cleaner fish and less likely to be eaten. 

The results from this study suggest that lice may have the capacity

Background Childhood pneumonia is a major cause 
of childhood illness and the second leading cause of 
child death globally.
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
Understanding the costs associ-
ated with the management of childhood pneumonia 
is essential for resource allocation and priority setting 
for child health.

Methods We conducted a systematic review to iden-
tify studies reporting data on the cost of management 
of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old. 
We collected unpublished cost data on non–severe, 
severe and very severe pneumonia through collabora-
tion with an international working group. We extract-
ed data on cost per
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
episode, duration of hospital stay 
and unit cost of interventions for the management of 
pneumonia. The mean (95% confidence interval, CI) 
and median (interquartile range, IQR) treatment costs 
were estimated and reported where appropriate.

Results We identified 24 published studies eligible for 
inclusion and supplemented these with data from 10 
unpublished studies. The 34 studies included in the 
cost analysis contained data on more than 95 000 chil-
dren with pneumonia from both low–
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
and–middle in-
come countries (LMIC) and high–income countries 
(HIC) covering all 6 WHO regions. The total cost (per 
episode) for management of severe pneumonia was 
US$ 4.3 (95% CI 1.5–8.7), US$ 51.7 (95% CI 17.4–
91.0) and US$ 242.7 (95% CI 153.6–341.4)–559.4 
(95% CI 268.9–886.3) in community, out–patient fa-
cilities and different levels of hospital in–patient set-
tings in LMIC. Direct medical cost for severe pneumo-
nia in hospital inpatient settings was estimated to be 
26.6%–115.8% of
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
patients’ monthly household in-
come in LMIC. The mean direct non–medical cost and 
indirect cost for severe pneumonia management ac-
counted for 0.5–31% of weekly household income. 
The mean length of stay (LOS) in hospital for children 
with severe pneumonia was 5.8 (IQR 5.3–6.4) and 7.7 
(IQR 5.5–9.9) days in LMIC and HIC respectively for 
these children.

Conclusion This is the most comprehensive review to 
date of cost data from studies on the management of 
childhood pneumonia and these
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
data should be help-
ful for health services planning and priority setting by 
national programmes and international agencies.

Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality in children under–five globally, and accounted for 
about 935 000 (15%) deaths in 2013 and 120 million new 
episodes of illness in this age group in 2010 [1,2].
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
Appro-
priate management of childhood pneumonia can reduce 
pneumonia–specific mortality by 32–72% [3–5] and thus 
accelerate the progress toward achievement of the Millen-
nium Development Goal 4 (MDG4). Childhood pneumonia 
places a large economic burden on families and the health 
care system, especially in resource–constrained low– and 
middle–income countries (LMIC). Severe ALRI is a substan-
tial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause 
of hospital referral and admission in
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
young children [6]. Al-
though several studies in high–income as well as low– and 
middle–income countries have reported the costs associ-
ated with an episode of pneumonia (at the individual pa-
tient level), there are no published systematic reviews sum-
marizing the evidence from different health systems and 
settings globally. Bahia et al reviewed pneumococcal disease 
costs and productivity loss in Latin America and the Carib-
bean showed variation in unit costs of pneumococcal pneu-
monia
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
at outpatient and inpatient levels [7]. We aimed to 
conduct a systematic review of published data on the costs 
associated with management of pneumonia episodes in chil-
dren younger than 5 years and to identify unpublished data 
sets from pneumonia research groups globally. Cost esti-
mates based on these data should be useful to develop mod-
els for estimating cost of management of pneumonia in 
community as well as hospital–based settings.

METHODS

Review of published studies

We aimed to
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
identify all published studies reporting em-
pirical cost data on the treatment of episodes of pneumonia 
in children aged below 5 years during a 15–year period 
(1998–2013). We included studies in children younger 
than 5 years with pneumonia managed as in–patients or 
out–patients (using standard treatment per local standard) 
in secondary and tertiary hospitals, first level facility or in 
community settings. Data on the cost of a single episode of 
severe pneumonia from the societal and
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
health care per-
spectives were collected as the primary study outcome. We 
developed a review protocol at the beginning of this study 
and followed the same throughout the process.

We undertook a systematic literature review with three re-
viewers (PS, IK, SZ), and hand searched reference list of all 
included articles. We searched four databases (with online 
search tools) to offer maximum coverage of the relevant lit-
erature: Medline, EMBASE, The Centre for Review and Dis-
semination
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
Library (incorporating the DARE, NHS EED, 
and NHS HTA databases); and The Cochrane Library (via 

the Wiley Online Library) for the period 1 January 1998 to 
October 31 2013. (for search strategy, see Appendix S1 in 
Online Supplementary Document).

Three review authors (SZ, PS, IK) independently selected 
potentially relevant studies based on their title and abstract. 
Any disagreements in study selection or data extraction 
were resolved after discussion with SZ and HC. The eligible 
studies
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
were retrieved electronically for full–text review. We 
included studies that investigated all–cause pneumonia in 
a non–selective population sample, reported empirical cost 
data for pneumonia treatment (using any intervention in-
cluding, but not limited to, antibiotics), and included only 
children younger than 5 years or reported data separately 
for this age group. We excluded review articles, vaccine 
cost–effectiveness trials, and studies considering specially 
selected cohorts with
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
severe co–morbidity (Appendix S2 
in Online Supplementary Document). We developed and 
piloted a comprehensive data extraction template. We col-
lected data on cost per episode, cost and unit cost of med-
ication and services, duration of hospital stay and direct 
medical and non–medical costs. Direct medical cost in-
cluded costs related to medication, diagnostic tests, medi-
cal staff time and hospital stay. Direct non–medical costs 
included those relating to food, transportation and
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
accom-
modation charges. Any additional data on indirect costs 
such as care–givers’ time and earning loss were also record-
ed, where available. Additionally, we extracted data on 
study characteristics including country, treatment setting, 
study type and sample size. We recorded the cost study 
perspective only if explicitly stated in the text of the article 
to avoid subjective influence. For those papers that did not 
explicitly state the perspective used, we noted “–“ for
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
“un-
stated”.

We classified countries into high income and low–and–
middle income categories based on the classification ad-
opted by the World Bank and according to 2012 Gross Na-
tional Income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World 
Bank Atlas method. The groups are low–income per capi-
ta US$ 1035 or less; lower middle–income US$ 1036–US$ 
4085; upper middle income US$ 4086–US$ 12 615; and 
high income US $12 616 or more [8].

Quality assessment

We assessed the quality of the
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
included studies using a 13 
point scale based on a modified Drummond checklist [9] 
for economic evaluation focusing on the methodological 
robustness and detail of reporting (Appendix S3 in Online 
Supplementary  Document).  Studies  were  considered 
high quality if more than 10 points were addressed, me-
dium quality studies covered 7–9 points and low quality 
studies addressed less than 6 points. Studies with all qual-
ity levels were included in the final analysis.

Unpublished data collection

We collected unpublished data from 10 collaborating sites 
that were part of a Severe ALRI Working Group (SAWG) 
[6]. The study population included children under 5 years 
of age with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. We defined 
pneumonia using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 
Integrated Mangement of Childhood Illness (ICMI) defini-
tion by three different
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
severity categories: non–severe, se-
vere and very severe pneumonia based on WHO pocket 
book for hospital care for children 2005 [10]. We included 
all interventions for pneumonia management as detailed in 
the WHO pocket–book (for community/and facility–based 
management) where data were available.

We designed a costing spreadsheet with detailed descrip-
tions of case definitions and methods and used this for data 
collection. Actual cost of medications, supplies, personnel 
and average
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
laboratory costs were collected. Methods used 
to gather primary cost data in these studies were recorded 
in the spreadsheet. Resource utilization data from patient 
records were also documented, where available, including 
length of stay in hospital, the quantity of drugs and sup-
plies utilized by each patient, and the use of diagnostic tests 
and procedures. We also attempted to collect data on out–
of–pocket spending (by patients) on transport and food 
where possible. Indirect cost of

caregivers’ time and daily 
pay rate were also recorded. Primary data collection was 
conducted using the provided standardized templates and 
guidelines at individual study site. (Appendix S4 in Online 
Supplementary Document).

We used a bottom–up approach to calculate cost per epi-
sode for each level of the intervention (community, first 
level health facility and hospital). Costs were calculated and 
presented separately based on severity and service delivery 
channels: very severe

as pneumonia with central cyanosis, inability to breastfeed 
or drink, or vomiting everything, convulsions, lethargy or 
unconsciousness and severe respiratory distress diagnosed 
by doctor or physicians using WHO IMCI (2005) case def-

nia need for hospital admission based on physician’s assess-
ment); severe pneumonia at community level (based on 
assessment by a trained health worker at home/first level 
facility using WHO IMCI (2005) case definition); and non–
severe  pneumonia  at  outpatient  level  (defined  as  fast 
breathing for age in children aged 2 to 59 months). The 
costing model included direct medical cost, direct non–
medical cost and indirect costs. We calculated the cost per 
episode based on the
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
estimates of the unit cost per contact 
(eg, unit cost of an antibiotic per day) at each management 
level multiplied by the resource utilization proportions (eg, 
80% of children took amoxicillin for 5 days), plus indirect 
costs. For the mean total cost of treatment per episode we 
summed the cost of drugs, diagnostic investigations and 
hospital stay, as well as transportation and opportunity cost 
for caregivers’ time. The formula is given in Figure 1.

We reported all cost data in 2013 US$
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
equivalent prices. 
We first converted all costs to US$ and then adjusted for 
inflation to 2013 values. Conversions were made using the 
Penn World Tables 8.0 (http://www.ggdc.net/pwt) and an 
online inflation–calculating tool (http://usinflation.org/cpi–
inflation–calculator) on 20th October 2013.

Statistical analysis

We have stratified the cost results by country income cate-
gory: high–income countries (HIC) and low– and middle–
income countries (LMIC). As an important input in the
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
cost-
ing analysis for in–patient management, length of stay (LOS) 
in hospital was extracted for severe hospitalized cases. Cost 
per episode, cost by component (direct medical, direct non–
medical and indirect costs), and percentage of total cost per 
episode in each component were summarized. Cost per ep-
isode was synthesized by severity of diseases in each strata. 
The mean with 95% CI of the treatment costs and the me-
dian with interquartile range (IQR) of LOS were estimated 
and
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
reported where appropriate. The 95% CIs were calcu-
lated based on 5000 bootstrap samples. Mean and median 
values were compared using appropriate statistical tests.

Direct medical cost in studies reported from household 
perspective were compared with monthly household in-
come in respective countries to evaluate the burden on

families. Monthly household incomes were derived from 
Gallup World Poll using annual median household income 
divided by 12 months [11]. These income results were 
based on Gallup data gathered between 2006 and 2012 in 
131 populations. In two countries which annual household 
income data was missing, we used GNI per capita from 
World Bank database times the mean number of people per 
household instead. The percentages of direct non–medical 
costs and indirect cost per episode of weekly

Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
household 
income were also assessed to show the economic impact of 
pneumonia management for families when direct medical 
cost was not considered.

We conducted all data analyses using SPSS v.19 (IBM, New 
York City, NY, USA) noting that included studies showed 
marked heterogeneity of population, methodology, treat-
ment procedure reporting categories and perspectives.

RESULTS

Search results

We identified 789 studies through database searching, of 
which
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
60 articles were eligible for full text review on the ba-
sis of title and abstract assessment (Figure 2). Subsequently, 
only 24 papers were identified to be eligible for data extrac-

tion and analysis. The key reasons for exclusions included: 
no data for children below 5 years or no cost data on pneu-
monia management were reported. For unpublished studies, 
we contacted 16 sites, 10 of which had data that met our 
eligibility criteria and contributed to the analysis. The un-
published cost

data were for the period January 2001 to Au-
gust 2012. Six of these sites provided cost data using a tem-
plate  and  guidelines  designed  for  this  project  while  the 
remainder provided unpublished data in their own formats.

Characteristics of published and 
unpublished data

We identified 24 studies from the literature review and col-
lected additional 10 data sets of unpublished studies total-

were conducted in the South East Asia and Africa Regions. 
The included studies reported data from a variety of treat-
ment settings: community, out–patient and in–patient care 
settings in primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals, and 
at city, district, provincial and national levels. Twenty–sev-
en of the 34 studies were stand–alone primary cost analy-

§The cost analysis of treatment of a disease.

The included studies reported cost data on a total of 97 062 
children treated at facility or community levels, with a me-
dian sample size of 378 (IQR 117–741) across all studies. 
The age of the participants was reported in 12 studies and 
the median age was 12.3 months (IQR 8.20–33.20). The 
perspective
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
of costing was explicitly stated in 30 of 34 stud-
ies. Of these, the most common perspectives were societal 
(16 out of 33, 1 study did not specify perspective), health 
care (11 out of 33) and household (5 out of 33). In most 
studies, the sources of pneumonia case definition were 
physician’s diagnosis according to WHO IMCI definition 
(29 out of 34), culture–proved pneumonia was used for 
case definition in 1 study, self–reported condition accord-
ing to WHO IMCI definition was adopted in
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
one study, and 
two studies used health workers’ diagnosis. A number of 
different sources were used for gathering cost data, the 
most common being through hospital records and costing 

interviews/questionnaires. Interviews and questionnaires 
were commonly used in studies with a household perspec-
tive to collect data on indirect costs. Other sources includ-
ed a national database of costs, insurance databases, sur-
veillance data and pharmaceutical databases. The WHO 
CHOICE  database, 
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
expert  opinion  and  data  from  pilot 
studies were also used to collect data on the unit cost of 
pneumonia treatment.

The average quality score of 24 published studies was 8.21 
out of 13 on scale based on modified Drummond checklist 
(range 3–12) (Appendix S5 in Online Supplementary 
Document). The majority of the studies failed to consider 
discounting and did not perform sensitivity analyses. There 
were 6 studies considered high quality, 14 studies were me-
dium quality, and 4 low

Cost of management per episode of 
pneumonia

Cost results stratified by income category are presented in 
Table 2, Table 3 and Figure 3. In HICs, the mean cost of 
treatment for an episode of severe pneumonia at the hos-
pital out–patient level was US$ 251.1 in Germany [16]. An 
Australian study [14] reported similar cost of US$ 254.9
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
for community management of severe pneumonia. Average 
costs of facility based case management for young children 
admitted in primary/sary and tertiary hospitals were US$ 
2803.5 (95% CI IQR 2000.6–3683.3), and US$ 7037.2 
(95% CI 4028.6–11 311.0) respectively, which was 11–28 
fold higher than in those managed as out–patients. The to-
tal cost per episode for the management of non–severe 
pneumonia at out–patient level was also reported for three 
countries: US$55.8 in Uruguay [12], US$ 272.7
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
in Chile 
[12] and US$ 334.6 in the United States [36]. The cost for 
very severe pneumonia managed in general pediatric wards 
followed by intensive care unit (ICU) care was reported to 
be US$9151.3 in a tertiary hospital in Spain [17] and US$ 
120 576.3 in the United States, which is nearly 2–17 fold 
of the cost for severe pneumonia management in hospital

studies included direct non–medical costs and indirect 
costs [16]. The mean proportion of the total cost for direct 
medical,  direct  non–medical  and  indirect  costs  were 
41.5%, 19.5% and 38.5% respectively.

In LMICs, the cost of case management for severe pneumo-
nia was reported across all treatment settings. The commu-
nity management cost was only reported in studies conduct-
ed in South–East Asia region, with a mean cost of US$ 4.3 
(95% CI

were US$ 51.7 (95% CI 17.4–91.0) per case. Costs for in–
patient care varied by regions, level of hospitals (primary/
sary/tertiary), and levels of care offered at a facility: the mean 
cost  for  primary/sary  hospital  care  was  242.7  (95%  CI 
153.6–341.4) and for tertiary/teaching hospital was 559.4 
(95% CI 268.9–886.3). Two groups–severe pneumonia by 
WHO IMCI definition and hospitalized pneumonia by phy-
sician’s diagnosis–showed

similar costs in all levels of care. 
The in–patient care costs were 4–11 fold greater than that 
for out–patient care in the LMICs strata, which in turn was 
significantly higher than that for community management.

Figure 3. Range of cost per episode for 
pneumonia management (2013 US$).

The costs for management of non–severe pneumonia man-
aged at outpatient level were US$ 66.9 (95% CI 21.7–
129.7), which was slightly higher than for severe cases at 
outpatient level.
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
This is because the hospital short stay for 
non–severe pneumonia in South Africa [22] was relatively 
high at US$ 263.1 per episode. The mean cost for very se-
vere cases was US$ 6496.0 (2246.2–12 007.4), which is 
nearly 10-fold of severe case management cost.

There were 6 studies reporting cost from household per-
spective, mainly from LMICs in South East Asia Region. 
Direct medical cost for severe pneumonia in hospital inpa-
tient settings were 26.6%–115.8% of the monthly house-
hold
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
income, thus demonstrating that severe pneumonia 
management in hospital placed a significant financial bur-
den on families. On the other hand, outpatient and com-
munity management of severe pneumonia accounted for 

only 0.4%–4.1% of family’s monthly income indicating de-
creased burden in these settings. (Table 4).

Of the papers reporting cost component of severe pneumo-
nia management, direct medical cost was reported across all 
studies and accounted for 45%–100% of the total cost. The
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
mean direct non–medical cost and indirect cost were US$ 
22.0  (11.8–32.7)  and  US$  27.0  (4.0–54.3)  respectively, 
which account for 0.5%–31.0% of weekly household in-
come (Table 5).

Length of stay in hospital

The in–patient cost was determined primarily by the length 
of stay (LOS) and the average cost per bed day. In this re-
view, we extracted length of stay for severe pneumonia for 
future costing analysis reference (Tables 6–8).

ranged from 7.4 to 18.3 days. The mean and median LOS 
were 13.7 (95% CI IQR 9.2–18.2) and 14.5
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
(IQR 10.1–
18.1) days in HIC, and 9.5 (95%CI, 7.4–11.8) and 9.2 
(IQR 6.1–12.6) days in LMIC.

Unit cost of treatment and resource uptake should be rou-
tinely reported in cost studies. However, only 13 of the 34 
included studies reported these data. Since treatment pro-
tocols (use of antibiotics, diagnostic tests, procedures and 
levels and intensity of care) varied between studies, this 
contributed to variations in costs across studies. For exam-
ple, the average cost of chest radiograph
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
in LMIC was US$ 
8.4 (95% CI 4.3–27.0), which was significantly lower than 
US$ 185.5 (95% CI 66.3–357.7) in high income countries 
(Table 9). We attempted to abstract unit cost data but were 
unable to include it in the presented direct medical costs 
because of paucity of information.

DISCUSSION

This is the first attempt to conduct a systematic review of 
all published and available unpublished cost data on the 
management of childhood pneumonia. Costs per episodes 
in HICs were 5–13–fold
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
higher in all delivery channels 
than those in LMICs. The review demonstrates that the 
magnitude of cost per episode increases markedly as the 
level of treatment delivery rises. Community management 
for severe pneumonia was less than 10% that of the cost of 
out–patient management among all levels of management 
in LMICs. Thus, there are strong economic reasons for con-
sidering community case management as a central strategy 
for pneumonia case management in low income countries; 
this

merits further evaluation which should include con-
sideration of medical outcomes. The mean lengths of stay

were close to the WHO recommendation of 5 
days in–patient treatment [10].

We demonstrated that the cost (per episode) for the man-
agement of severe pneumonia varied greatly by unit cost of 
intervention, disease severity and treatment procedures in 
different settings. The review also demonstrated that major 
factors governing the total cost per episode were length of 
stay in the hospital, countries income level and the pres-
ence or absence of community case management for pneu-
monia.

Many other studies have also found GDP per cap-
ita  to  be  the  main  driver  of  costs  [37].  These  findings 

demonstrate that choosing the appropriate value for these 
inputs will have a significant influence on the total cost. 
Existing studies calculated pneumonia management costs 
in many countries assuming the same treatment procedure 
and unit cost of medicine. However, the cost data we col-
lected demonstrate that this method may have limitations; 
the uncertainty in the

traditional estimates can be measured 
using the cost data reported in this review.

Our results showed that direct medical costs for childhood 
pneumonia management, especially inpatients, represent a 
significant proportion of the average monthly household 
income for families in LMICs. This is often compounded 
by further direct non–medical cost and indirect cost ie, loss

of earnings when caring for the sick child. In countries 
where these families were uninsured, health payments for 
pneumonia management were a heavy burden on house-
hold and can have a significant impact on the family, par-
ticularly when the payments for care were out–of–pocket 
in most LMIC countries. Alamgir et al investigated the im-
pact that this strain had on families and how they source 

the funds: many borrow or take high–interest loans [26]. 
Furthermore,
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
Ayieko et al found that 10% of the patients in 
district hospitals and up to 25% of children in tertiary hos-
pitals wait in hospital beds after medical discharge while 
families source the fees. The latter translates to an addition-
al cost of US$ 17.46 to the public provider and US$ 5.32 
to the family [32], resulting in a drain on both the resourc-
es of the family and the health care provider, as well as de-
nying a bed to another sick child. It is therefore important 
that  national 
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
strategies  for  pneumonia  management  in 
LMIC are not only cost–effective for the national program 
but also give attention to the burden of costs on families so 
that these are maintained at a level that is affordable.

The data in this review comprise “actual” cost data measured 
in cost studies conducted in many LMIC and HIC. We be-
lieve that these represent a fair first approximation of true 
costs in these countries. It is noteworthy that the resulting 
cost estimates are higher than
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
those currently contained in 
the WHO–CHOICE estimates [38]. Three factors could have 
contributed to this variation. First, we identified longer facil-
ity and hospital stays compared to standard treatment pro-
tocols recommended by the WHO [39]. Moreover, most ex-
isting cost studies were conducted at tertiary level hospitals 
where out–patient and in–patient treatments carry a much 
higher cost compared to the community or first level facility. 
Third, the wide variety of antibiotics
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
(including variations in 
dosage, route of administration and duration) across the 
sites, as well as the heterogeneity in the costing methodol-
ogy and the cost components in existing studies may have 
led to higher estimates.

This review has several limitations. First, the primary goal 
of the systematic review was to obtain data on cost of man-
agement (per episode) of
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
severe pneumonia. However, the 
lack of any standard management protocols (which varied 
widely across the included studies) and the general lack of 
service uptake data, may have contributed to the substantial 
uncertainty around the estimates. Second, we did not in-
clude costs of diagnostic investigations in the cost modeling 
in some study sites, because country–specific unit prices and 
utilization data were not available. Therefore, the true eco-
nomic burden resulting from the management
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
of childhood 
pneumonia could be considerably higher. Third, costs were 
highly dependent on level of care offered at facility and LOS 
could be skewed to longer period if high level of care (such 
as intensive care unit (ICU) care) was offered to severe and 
very severe cases. In this review, severe cases were all man-
aged at non–ICU hospital settings, and very severe cases 
were managed at both non–ICU and ICU care in hospital 
settings. We were able to report LOS separately for non–ICU 
and
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
ICU care but this stratification was not possible for total 
cost per episode. A further limitation was that the definition 
of ICU and ICU care may vary by country. Fourthly, we lim-
ited the search to English articles only, which may exclude 
some cost reported in other languages, however only 13 
studies out of 789 articles in other languages were found. 
We tried to compliment this with unpublished data from 
non–English speaking countries. Lastly, there was a wide 
range in per capita
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
income and health care system and pay-
ment schemes within LMIC category and the existing cost 
data may only reflect the situation when and where the data 
were collected and may not be representative of the whole 
country or the current situation. Furthermore, there were 
not sufficient studies to address all possible cost scenarios to 
facilitate international and public/private comparisons.

Cost of managing severe pneumonia in young children

Our results demonstrate that further research
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
on the eco-
nomic burden due to the management of childhood pneu-
monia is needed, with clear reporting of data on unit cost 
of intervention, dosage of various drugs and information 
on health care utilization, such as length of stay in hospital. 
We recommend that standard reporting of unit cost of in-
tervention with direct medical and non–medical costs and 
indirect costs, standard treatment protocols and health re-
source utilization in conjunction with the total cost per 
episode in any
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
cost–of–illness studies would facilitate eco-
nomic estimates of national scale–up and international 
comparisons. Further studies on the cost–effectiveness of 
standardized IMCI protocol against other treatment proto-
cols could be expected to find a cost–saving management 
strategy for high burden countries.

Identifying the most cost–effective interventions for pneu-
monia management is essential for achieving the goal of 
further reducing child mortality. Our study demonstrated 
that early
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
treatment in the community costs less (per event) 
than late treatment in the hospital. This finding suggests 
that the public health community should explore ways for 
community outreach for early diagnosis and treatment be-
fore severe pneumonia sets in. The results from this sys-
tematic review provide important missing information on 
the cost of pneumonia treatment in children across many 
countries. These data and the cost estimates should provide 
important information useful to program
----
Source: jogh-06-010408.pdf
managers and 
policy makers at national and regional levels, international 
agencies, and donor organisations to aid resource alloca-
tion, program planning and priority setting. The estimates 
presented in this review could enable a more detailed eco-
nomic evaluation of the revised WHO pneumonia manage-
ment guidelines [39], and help identify the most cost–ef-
fective preventive and treatment interventions for reducing 
the burden of childhood pneumonia.

Does Medicine without Evolution Make Sense?

Catriona J. MacCallum

It is curious that Charles Darwin, 

perhaps medicine’s most famous 
dropout, provided the impetus 
for a subject that ﬁ gures so rarely in 
medical education. Indeed, even the 
iconic textbook example of evolution—
antibiotic resistance—is rarely 
described as “evolution” in relevant 
papers published in medical journals 
[1]. Despite potentially valid reasons 
for this oversight (e.g., that authors 
of papers in
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
medical journals would 
regard the term as too general), it 
propagates into the popular press when 
those papers are reported on, feeding 
the wider perception of evolution’s 
irrelevance in general, and to medicine 
in particular [1]. Yet an understanding 
of how natural selection shapes 
vulnerability to disease can provide 
fundamental insights into medicine 
and health and is no less relevant than 
an understanding of physiology or 
biochemistry.

One reason that evolution doesn’t 

ﬁ gure
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
prominently in the medical 
community is that although it makes 
sense to have evolution taught as part 
of medicine, that doesn’t make it 
essential. As explained at a meeting 
on evolution and medicine I recently 
attended in York, United Kingdom 
(the Society for the Study of Human 
Biology and the Biosocial Society’s 2006 
symposium, “Medicine and Evolution”), 
medicine is primarily focused on 
problem-solving and proximate 
causation, and ultimate explanations 
can seem irrelevant to
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
clinical practice. 
Crudely put, does a mechanic need to 
understand the origins, history, and 
technological advances that have gone 
into the modern motor vehicle in order 
to ﬁ x it?

Randolph Nesse (University of 
Michigan) and colleagues think 
otherwise [2], and have been 
campaigning for evolution to be 
recognized and taught as a basic 
science to all medical students (see also 
the Evolution and Medicine Network, 
http:⁄⁄www.evolutionandmedicine.
org). It has been more than 10 
years

since he and George Williams 
published their classic book Why We 
Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian

Medicine [3]. Other landmark texts 
linking evolution to health have been 
written since then, with new editions on 
the way [4–6], and the research ﬁ eld is 
blossoming. Still, as Nesse mentioned 
at the start of the York meeting, there 
are only a handful of medical schools 
in the United States and in the United 
Kingdom with
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
an evolutionary biologist 
listed as such on the faculty.

The most obvious examples of 
evolutionary biology’s importance to 
medical understanding are related to 
infectious disease [7]. As Jon Laman 
(Erasmus University, The Netherlands) 
pointed out at the meeting, the 
immune system provides the perfect 
platform to explain the medical 
relevance of the exquisite evolutionary 
relationships between pathogens 
and their hosts. Understanding how 
virulence evolves, for example, can 
help
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
predict the potential, sometimes 
counterintuitive (and controversial) 
negative consequences of imperfect 
vaccination [8,9]. But evolution can 
also tell us that the origin of HIV 

was precipitated by a jump across 
the primate species barrier [10] and 
enables us to predict the imminent 
arrival of avian ﬂ u and the mutations 
most likely to be responsible for that 
evolutionary leap from birds to humans 
[11]. Where epidemiological and 
population genetic processes occur on 
the same time
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
scale, the emerging ﬁ eld 
of “phylodyamics” can also inform us 
about the timing and progression of 
pathogen adaptation more generally 
[12].

The relevance of evolution to 

medicine is, however, much broader.

Greaves, Institute of Cancer

in intense social 
disputes (Ed Hagen, Humboldt 
University). 

As with any emerging ﬁ eld, ideas 
change and the science is challenged. 
The thrifty gene concept [13]—that 
some populations (e.g., from Polynesia) 
are particularly susceptible to type 2 
diabetes and heart disease because 
of past selection pressure speciﬁ cally 
during times of famine—no longer 
enjoys the support it once had [14]. 
Tessa Pollard (University of Durham, 
UK) explained that the so-called 
Syndrome X is now
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
considered to be 
the result of more general exposure to 
a rapid change in lifestyle as Western 
society encroached on these populations 
during the mid-20th century. The 
relationship between changing 
environment, diet, and susceptibility to 
disease, however, is also far from clear. 
Many diet-related conditions that typify 
industrialized populations—e.g., obesity, 
hypertension, and tooth decay—have 
been explained as resulting from an 
evolutionary mismatch between our 
over-reﬁ ned,
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
fat-ﬁ lled contemporary 
diet and the environment to which 
humans were once ideally adapted. 
Sarah Elton (Hull York Medical School, 
UK) cautioned that while this analogy 
(the “environment of evolutionary 
adaptedness”) has been useful as a 
research tool and has led to public 
health campaigns for better diets (more 
seeds, nuts, ﬁ sh oil, etc.), recreating 
such a typical “Stone Age diet” as a 
benchmark can be misleading. Human 
ecology in the past was at least as 
variable as human (and
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
other primate) 
ecology is today.

Surprisingly, an evolutionary 

framework to study human variation 

can be seen as counterproductive. 
George Ellison (St. George’s Medical 
School, UK) provided an example, 
although not concerning evolutionary 
medicine, about a statistically ﬂ awed 
study leading to spurious conclusions 
about regional variation in IQ (which 
I won’t promulgate here). However, 
bad papers are published in all 
subjects and are a failure of scientists 
and the peer-review
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
system, not the 
science. These should not provide 
an excuse to dismiss the relevance 
of evolution to medicine (or to any 
other life science). Even at a very 
basic level, medical students can draw 
insights from evolution they cannot 
obtain from other core sciences on 
their course. Paul O’Higgins (Hull 
York Medical School) noted that it is 
much easier for medics to learn the 
nerves involved in the brachial plexus 
(the nerves supplying the arm) if they 
ﬁ rst understand the origin of
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
the 
pentadactyl limb.

It is not the case, however, that all 
clinicians fail to see the relevance of 
evolution. Gillian Bentley (now at 
University of Durham) conducted 
a series of interviews with leading 
biologists and clinicians when she was 
based at Imperial College London. 
What was surprising was not the positive 
endorsement of evolution by the 
geneticists and evolutionary biologists 
but the enthusiasm of practicing 
medical doctors for the topic, whether 
involved in the active
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
birth movement 
or dealing with major trauma in 
intensive care. Indeed, several local 
clinicians attended the York meeting 
and helped lead the discussions. 
Ironically, the hardest task in 
adding evolutionary/Darwinian 
medicine to medical curricula may 
well be soliciting support from medical 
students. Although Paul O’Higgins 
thought a comparison of the brachial 
plexus to the pentadactyl limb was 
helpful, not all his students agreed—
complaints were lodged that he was 
forcing
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
evolution on them. That lack 
of support was also reﬂ ected in the 
participation of only three medical 
students at the York meeting (albeit 
enthusiastic ones), despite being widely 
publicized. It is not clear whether this 
is because medical students are more 
overburdened than most or because of 
a more deep-rooted resistance to the 
subject, reﬂ ecting wider political and 

religious prejudice against evolution. 
But evolutionary medicine isn’t and 
shouldn’t be controversial, and the
----
Source: MacCallum2007.pdf
best way to challenge prejudice is 
through education. As the oft-quoted 
Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote in 1973, 
“Nothing in biology makes sense except 
in the light of evolution” [15]. The 
time has clearly come for medicine 
to explicitly integrate evolutionary 
biology into its theoretical and practical 
underpinnings The medical students 
of Charles Darwin’s day did not have 
the advantage of such a powerful 
framework to inform their thinking; 
we shouldn’t deprive today’s budding 
medical
----

talent of the potential insights 
to be gained at the intersection of these 
two great disciplines. (cid:1)

Global governance of antimicrobial resistance

Ensuring  future  generations  have  access  to  anti-
microbials  is  high  on  the  agenda  for  many  heads  of 
state, and almost all Ministers of Health. Following the 
UN 
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
General  Assembly’s  2016  High-Level  Meeting  on 
antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR),  an  ad-hoc  Interagency 
Coordination  Group  (IACG),  co-chaired  by  the  UN 
Deputy  Secretary-General  and  the  Director-General  of 
WHO,  was  tasked  with  providing  guidance  to  political 
leaders  on  approaches  needed  to  promote  sustainable 
action on AMR.1

Failure  to  tackle  AMR  threatens  the  attainment  of 
various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—including 
those  on  poverty

Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
reduction,  reduced  inequalities,  clean 
water,  and  sanitation—and  progress  already  made  will 
be  lost.2,3 With  just  over  12  months  remaining  until  the 
IACG  is  due to  report  back to the  UN  Secretary-General, 
its  recommendations  must  seek  to  improve  the  global 
governance  of  AMR  for  the  long  term  while  supporting 
the development of a “21st-century UN”.4

The rising threat of AMR in human beings is neither new 
nor  rare;  drug-resistant  infections  are

Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
already  estimated 
to  cause  700 000  annual  deaths  globally.5  A  leading 
concern  is  multidrug-resistant  tuberculosis  that  resulted 
in 240 000 deaths worldwide in 2016.6 The emergence of 
resistance is a natural phenomenon but is accelerated by 
a complex combination of human activity in health care, 
agriculture (including animal husbandry, aquaculture, and 
crops), and environmental contamination.7,8

The  costs  of  not  addressing  the  rising  rates  of  AMR 
could lead to an
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
annual reduction in global gross domestic 
product  of  3·8%  by  2050.3  Low-income  and  middle-
income  countries  (LMICs)  are  set  to  be  hit  the  hardest, 
and  will  almost  certainly  experience  increased  poverty 
and inequality as a result of AMR.3 Further, the appropriate 
and 
inappropriate  use  of  antimicrobials,  particularly 
antibiotics,  leads  to  resistance  that  takes  human  lives. 
However,  in  many  countries  lack  of  access  to  safe  and 
affordable

Commentburden; an estimated 5·7 million deaths annually are the 
result of a lack of access to antibiotics.9

There is an emerging consensus that efforts to contain 
the  threat  of  AMR  should  focus  on  four  key  objectives. 
First,  ensure  appropriate  use  of  antibiotics  in  both 
human  and  animal  health,  over  time  eliminating  the 
unnecessary  use  of  antibiotics  in 
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
agriculture.  Second, 
eradicate  untreated  effluent  in  both  animal  and  human 
health. Third, improve prevention of AMR with infection 
prevention  and  control  (ICP)  and  water,  sanitation,  and 
hygiene  (WASH)  programmes  in  all  sectors.  Finally, 
ensure  that  all  who  need  them  have  appropriate  access 
to  a  regulated  supply  of  quality-assured,  affordable 
antimicrobials.10  These  global  objectives  should  be 
supported  by 
the  appropriate  development  and
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
stewardship  of  new  diagnostics  and  vaccines,  as  well  as 
new antibiotics and alternatives.

The Tripartite Collaboration on AMR is the current UN-
focused  governance  arrangement,  comprising WHO, the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO),  and  the  World  Organisation  for  Animal  Health 
(OIE). However, there are limitations with this governance 
arrangement. Global public goods such as antimicrobials 
can  only  be  preserved  if  all  countries 
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
cooperate.  A 
multistakeholder, multisectoral, and truly global response 
to AMR is required. This response needs to be reinforced 
by  stronger  global  governance  that  has  a  mandate 
across  health,  agriculture,  and  the  environment  and  is 
supported by a well resourced secretariat.11 This approach 
would include four elements. First, an effective mandate 
to  encourage  countries  to  make  binding  national 
commitments  with  support  provided  to  strengthen 
capacity, 
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
capability,  and  funding  for  alternatives  to 
antimicrobials  and  innovations  in  LMICs.  Second,  a 
process  for  reporting  on  these  commitments.  Third, 
the  capacity,  ability,  and  authority to  advocate  for AMR. 
Fourth, the  ability to  mobilise  all  stakeholders,  including 
the private sector, civil society, and philanthropic actors.

To inform the recommendations of the IACG to the UN 
Secretary-General, a small initial meeting of stakeholders 
was  convened  at  Leeds 
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
Castle  in  the  UK  under  the 
leadership  of  Dame  Sally  Davies,  Chief  Medical  Officer 
(CMO)  for  England,  member  of  the  IACG,  and  Chair  of 
the  subgroup  on  SDG  alignment,  global  governance 
post  2019,  and  the  UN  role  and  responsibilities. 
Representatives  included  the  Tripartite  authorities,  the 
private sector, and academic and multilateral experts.

The  meeting  concluded  that  a  future  international 
legal  agreement  is  urgently  needed  to  lock  in
----
Source: PIIS0140673618311176.pdf
long-
term  international  standards  and  norms  across  the 
private  and  public  sectors  and  ensure  that  antibiotics 
are available for future generations.12 Reaching such an

and  perseverance  from  a  wide  range  of  actors.  The 
group recommended that this might best be supported

One Health: a multifaceted concept combining diverse approaches to prevent and
control antimicrobial resistance

The term ‘One Health’ refers to a collaborative, multisectoral
and transdisciplinary approachdworking at the local,
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
regional,
national and global levelsdwith the goal of achieving optimal
health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between peo-
ple, animals, plants and their shared environment. Such a holistic
approach is required for effective control and prevention of many
infectious diseases, including emerging infections and antimicro-
bial resistance (AMR) [1]. In the case of AMR, this approach is
needed because many of the antimicrobial drugs used in human
medicine are also used in veterinary
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
medicine, and livestock pro-
duction and their use leads to selection of AMR, regardless of the
speciﬁc context in which they are used. Moreover, there is
increasing evidence that at least some clinically relevant resis-
tant bacteria and/or their resistance genes are able to transfer be-
tween animals and humans by overcoming ecological and
geographical barriers [2]. In line with this concept, the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion (FAO) and the World
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
Organization for Animal Health (OIE)
have joined forces to promote cross-sectoral collaboration to
assess, control and prevent the spread of AMR in human and an-
imal populations and in the environment. In 2019, the three or-
ganizations established a joint monitoring and evaluation
framework for implementation of the Global Action Plan (GAP)
on AMR that was launched by the World Health Assembly in
May 2015 [3]. This framework generates data to assess the deliv-
ery of GAP objectives, and will
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
inform operational and strategic
decision making relating to AMR in the years ahead.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases (ESCMID) and the ESCMID Study Group for Veterinary
Microbiology (ESGVM) have been key stakeholders in promoting
the importance of One Health in the ﬁght against AMR. They
have provided a forum to bring together multidisciplinary scien-
tists in the 2nd International Conference on One Health Antimicro-
bial Resistance (ICOHAR), held 16e18
----

April 2019 in Utrecht, the
Netherlands (http://www.icohar2019.org). The conference high-
lighted key themes in One Health and AMR where multidisciplinary
research is addressing key concerns, like zoonotic transmission of
AMR, surveillance and transfer of AMR, precision antimicrobial
therapy, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, animal models for
studying the effects of antimicrobial therapy on dysbiosis and
AMR development, the quality of university education on AMR
and antimicrobial therapy,
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
the impact of vaccination on antimicro-
bial use and management of critically ill patients.

This special issue contains three reviews selected by the Scien-
tiﬁc Committee of the 2nd ICOHAR to best represent the scientiﬁc

perspective of the meeting. Each paper focuses on a speciﬁc feature
of AMR prevention and control: surveillance [4], risk assessment [5]
and alternative anti-infective strategies [6]. Nielsen et al. [4]
reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of three diverse tools
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
for
evaluating integrated AMR surveillance systems, providing guid-
ance on how to choose a ﬁt-for-purpose tool. Wee et al. [5] high-
lighted the function of well-designed, high-resolution genome
sequencing approaches to quantify transmission of AMR at the
humaneanimal interface. Finally, Pollock et al. [6] outlined the
value of microbial and host genomics for developing alternative
strategies for prevention and control of infectious diseases in live-
stock, namely microbiota modulation via
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
faecal transplantation and
probiotics, genetic manipulation of the host via selective breeding
and gene editing, vaccines, antivirulence strategies and phage ther-
apy. Broadly speaking, the three reviews provide a timely perspec-
tive on some of the challenges posed by the occurrence of AMR at
the humaneanimal interface: evaluation of the efﬁciency of inte-
grated surveillance systems, quantiﬁcation of the risk of AMR trans-
mission between reservoirs and development of alternatives
ensuring
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
production of healthy animals with reduced antimicrobial
use. Addressing any of these challenges requires an interdisci-
plinary and multisectoral approach involving key stakeholders. In
other words, it requires implementation of the One Health concept.
The beneﬁts of the One Health are relevant to a large variety of pro-
fessionals, including researchers, diagnostic microbiologists, phar-
macologists and clinicians. In addition to the areas highlighted in
the reviews of this special issue,
----

multisectoral and transdisciplinary collaboration in the ﬁght against
AMR. Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics-driven therapy has
been shown to be a promising approach with which to optimize anti-
microbial therapy on the basis of the characteristics of the individual
patient or herd under treatment. It has become apparent that revision
of dosage regimens and development of drugs with improved phar-
macokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties are research goals

of antimicrobial therapy on the commensal microbiota.

The use of dogs as animal models to study the effects of antimi-

and discussed in light of the anatomical and physiologic similarities

breakpoints). Clinicians working in human and veterinary compan-
ion animal hospitals also face similar problems, including outbreaks
caused by the same multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g. methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum b-lactamase
(ESBL), or carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli) and imple-
mentation of the same key measures (i.e. hospital infection control
and antimicrobial stewardship) for preventing

and controlling their
spread within the clinic. Epidemiologic studies emphasize the
important role of companion animals as reservoirs in transmission
of AMR. Importantly, similar challenges are also faced in education
as indicated by two large independent surveys of ﬁnal-year students
at medicine and veterinary medicine universities in Europe, which
unequivocally indicated a strong need for a greater focus in the cur-
riculum on One Health and AMR.

Strikingly, recent articles have not
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
indicated a major contribu-
tion of the veterinary sector to the occurrence of AMR in humans,
even for AMR determinants that are usually located on mobile ge-
netic elements and are relatively common in food products of ani-
mal origin. For example, an unprecedented large-scale, population-
based modeling study in the Netherlands revealed that human-to-
human transmission (mean, 67%) is by far the main source of ESBL-
producing E. coli carriage in the open community, with relatively
low
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
contributions by food consumption and preparation (18.9%),
contact with companion animals (7.9%), nonoccupational contact
with farm animals (3.6%) and environmental sources (2.6%) [7].
Other studies have shown that the animal-to-human movement
of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in E. coli [8,9] and vanco-
mycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium [10] is less frequent than
previously hypothesized, suggesting that resistance to these high-
priority, critically important antimicrobials is
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
largely driven by hos-
pital use and human-to-human transmission.

It has been argued that these data should be interpreted as a
failure of the One Health approach to tackle AMR, meaning that
AMR should be handled separately in human and animal popula-
tions because of the weak epidemiologic linkage between human
and nonhuman sources. Although we tend to agree that the contri-
bution by veterinary use of antimicrobials to AMR problems in hu-
man medicine might have been overestimated in the
----
Source: PIIS1198743X20304183.pdf
past, at least
for developed countries in the western hemisphere, we utterly
reject the conclusion that control of AMR does not require a One
Health approach. The value of One Health is independent of the
risk of zoonotic transmission of AMR. It is intrinsically linked to
the need for shared information and joint training amongst the
professionals that are at the forefront of the ﬁght against AMR in
human and veterinary settings, namely general practitioners, infec-
tious disease specialists

Summary
Background Antimicrobial resistance is one of the great challenges facing global health security in the

Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
modern era. 
Wildlife,  particularly  those  that  use  urban  environments,  are  an  important  but  understudied  component  of 
epidemiology  of  antimicrobial  resistance.  We  investigated  antimicrobial  resistance  overlap  between  sympatric 
wildlife, humans, livestock, and their shared environment across the developing city of Nairobi, Kenya. We use these 
data to examine the role of urban wildlife in the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance.

Methods 99 households
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
across Nairobi were randomly selected on the basis of socioeconomic stratification. A detailed 
survey was administered to household occupants, and samples (n=2102) were collected from the faeces of 75 wildlife 
species inhabiting household compounds (ie, the household and its perimeter; n=849), 13 livestock species (n=656), 
and  humans  (n=333),  and  from  the  external  environment  (n=288).  Escherichia  coli,  our  sentinel  organism,  was 
cultured  and  a  single  isolate  from  each 
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
sample  tested  for  sensitivity  to  13  antibiotics.  Diversity  of  antimicrobial 
resistant phenotypes was compared between urban wildlife, humans, livestock, and the environment, to investigate 
whether wildlife are a net source for antimicrobial resistance in Nairobi. Generalised linear mixed models were used 
to determine whether the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant phenotypes and multidrug-resistant E coli carriage in 
urban wildlife is linked to variation in ecological traits,
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
such as foraging behaviour, and to determine household-level 
risk factors for sharing of antimicrobial resistance between humans, wildlife, and livestock.

Findings E coli were isolated from 485 samples collected from wildlife between Sept 6,2015, and Sept 28, 2016. Wildlife 
carried  a  low  prevalence  of  E  coli  isolates  susceptible  to  all  antibiotics  tested  (45  [9%]  of  485  samples)  and  a  high 
prevalence of clinically relevant multidrug resistance (252 [52%] of 485 samples),
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
which varied between taxa and by 
foraging traits. Multiple isolates were resistant to one agent from at least seven antimicrobial classes tested for, and a 
single isolate was resistant to all antibiotics tested for in the study. The phenotypic diversity of antimicrobial-resistant 
E coli in wildlife was lower than in livestock, humans, and the environment. Within household compounds, statistical 
models identified two interfaces for exchange of antimicrobial resistance: between both rodents,

Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
humans and their 
rubbish, and seed-eating birds, humans and their rubbish; and between seed-eating birds, cattle, and bovine manure.

Interpretation  Urban  wildlife  carry  a  high  burden  of  clinically  relevant  antimicrobial-resistant  E  coli  in  Nairobi, 
exhibiting  resistance  to  drugs  considered  crucial  for  human  medicine  by  WHO.  Identifiable  traits  of  the  wildlife 
contribute  to  this  exposure;  however,  compared  with  humans,  livestock,  and  the  environment, 
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
low  phenotypic 
diversity in wildlife is consistent with the hypothesis that wildlife are a net sink rather than source of clinically relevant 
resistance.  Wildlife  that  interact  closely  with  humans,  livestock,  and  both  human  and  livestock  waste  within 
households,  are  exposed  to  more  antimicrobial  resistant  phenotypes,  and  could  therefore  act  as  conduits  for  the 
dissemination of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance to the wider environment. These results

resistance in select species of urban wildlife, and a single study 
compared differences in prevalence between wildlife and 
livestock (cattle, on UK dairy farms). No published studies 
examined the presence of antimicrobial resistance across diverse 
urban wildlife taxa inhabiting the same urban environment, 
and no studies compared antimicrobial resistance in sympatric 
wildlife, livestock, and human populations.

Ecological and epidemiological approaches were applied to 
provide, to our knowledge, the first epidemiologically 
structured comparative analysis of phenotypic antimicrobial 
resistance characterisation in sympatric wildlife, livestock, 
humans, and the environment in an urban setting, and the 
most comprehensive analysis of urban wildlife-borne 
antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes so far. Because this study 
was done on a city-wide scale, it allowed us to evaluate carriage
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance in urban wildlife 
across Nairobi, and relate this to antimicrobial resistance in the 
broader urban epidemiological system. We present several 
important findings, showing that, although urban wildlife carry 
high burdens of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance, 
phenotypic diversity is lower than in humans, livestock, or the 
external environment. Wildlife that associate closely with 
livestock, humans, and both livestock and human waste
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
are 
exposed to higher levels of antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes 

than wildlife that do not associate as closely with livestock and 
human waste, and could thus act as conduits for dissemination 
to the wider environment. Our findings emphasise the 
importance of understanding ecological flows of antimicrobial 
resistance within complex urban systems, to inform strategies 
aimed at limiting human exposure to multidrug-resistant 
bacteria.

Implications of all the available evidence
The
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
results of this study and previous studies suggest that 
through anthropogenic exposure, wildlife have a taxa-specific 
role in the acquisition and dissemination of clinically relevant 
antimicrobial resistance across urban landscapes, and have the 
potential to disseminate antimicrobial resistance from urban 
areas to broader ecosystems. Similarly scaled future studies 
done in a variety of urban settings would permit examination 
of context-specific differences in wildlife antimicrobial
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
resistance carriage and exposure. More broadly, 
contamination of urban environments with antimicrobial 
resistance is a serious issue, and future studies should focus on 
identifying antimicrobial resistant flow through urban 
ecological systems, and relating this to coresistance and 
crossresistance to other environmental pollutants (such as 
heavy metals). Such evidence could be used to develop 
cost-effective surveillance for urban ecological systems, and to 
inform interventions that are
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
aimed at limiting environmental 
contamination with pollutants of public health significance. 
Ultimately, this work forms part of a broader strategy to 
understand the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance 
across developing urban landscapes.

outside human and livestock hosts, but it is increasingly 
clear  that  focusing  only  on  these  compartments  of  the 
transmission  system  will  result  in  an  incomplete 
epidemiological  picture  of  resistance.3  Bacterial  popu- 
lations  in
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
aquatic  and  soil  habitats  are  enormously 
diverse, and have crucial roles in nitrogen cycling, carbon 
sequestration,  and  the  stability  of  aquatic  ecosystems.4 
These bacteria also act as reservoirs of naturally occurring 
bacterial resistance, the burden of which is exacerbated 
by  flows  of  resistance  elements  and  other  chemicals 
(such as heavy metals) from livestock and human waste, 
which  can  coselect  for  drug  resistance.5  Resulting 
changes  to  microbial  diversity
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
could  lead  to  damaging 
effects  on  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecosystems,  such  as 
nitrification and mobilisation of heavy metals.6,7

Wildlife  exist  across  multiple  trophic  levels,  and  are 
therefore  well  placed  to  accumulate  and  disperse 
resistance  determinants  within  ecosystems.  Ecological 
traits, such as habitat, feeding preferences, and ranging 
behaviour  could  determine  the  exposure  of  wildlife 
species to antimicrobial resistance, and how widely it is
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
dispersed in the environment.8,9 The presence of diverse 
bacterial resistance profiles in wildlife inhabiting pristine 
environments  also  shows  the  complexity  of  naturally 

occurring  antimicrobial-resistant  communities  in  the 
gut of free-ranging vertebrates, for which environmental 
acquisition  probably  has  an  important  role.10,11  As  land-
use  changes  reduce  the  availability  of  natural  habitats, 
wildlife species are forced to seek alternative sources of 
food  and 
----
Source: PIIS254251961930083X.pdf
shelter,  bringing  them  into  closer  association 
with humans, livestock, and their waste, and increasing 
the  potential  for  transfer  of  antimicrobial  resistance 
between them.3,12

In lower-middle-income countries, urban environments 
act  as  hotspots  for  interactions  between  humans, 
animals, and their shared environment. The focus of this 
study  is  on  the  informal  keeping  of  livestock  by 
households in Nairobi, Kenya, as a potentially high-risk 
urban interface for

antimicrobial-resistant transmission 
between  wildlife,  humans,  livestock,  and  the  environ-
ment.  Livestock  are  frequently  kept  within  household 
perimeters in low-income country urban centres, where 
differing  levels  of  waste  management  could  cause 
variation in environmental dispersal of determinants of, 
and  exposure  of  wildlife  to,  antimicrobial  resistance.12

Using  E

defined  by  clinically  significant  human  treatment  break-
points  and  to  antibiotics  of  importance  in  human 
medicine,  the  true  clinical  relevance  of  antimicrobial 
resistance in urban wildlife is examined.13 Wildlife, which 
are not treated with antibiotics, might be a net recipient (or 
sink)  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  urban  environments, 
while  acting  as  an  effective  conduit  of  antimicrobial 
resistance  between  other  parts  of  the

hypotheses  are  tested  by  using  statistical  models  to 
compare  the  carriage  of  clinically  relevant  antimicrobial 
resistance  between 
compartments 
(ie, wildlife, humans, livestock, and the environment). To 
further  understand  the  determinants  of  exposure  of 
wildlife to antimicrobial resistance, variation in host taxon

in  each  sublocation  to  obtain  two  livestock-keeping 
and  one  non-livestock-keeping  household  (a  total  of 
99  households),  with  the  aim  of  maximising  the  spatial 
distribution  and  diversity  of  livestock-keeping  practices 
captured  within  the  sampling  frame.  Wildlife  samples 
were also obtained from an additional household, where 
the  occupants  declined  to  submit

questionnaire  data.  As  such,  100  households  were 
included in analyses in which isolates from wildlife were 
considered alone. Households in each sublocation had to 
meet strict inclusion criteria of keeping small ruminants 
or poultry, large ruminants or pigs, or no livestock within 
the  household  perimeter.  Abattoirs  in  Nairobi  were 

selected and sampled in a separate value chain study done 
as part of the wider UrbanZoo project.15 Wildlife samples 
were

obtained  by  a  range  of  taxon-specific  trapping 
methods,  which  are  described  in  the  appendix,  along 
with  protocols  for  collection  of  human,  livestock,  and 
environmental samples. Questionnaires detailing house-
hold composition and socioeconomic data, and live stock 
ownership and management, were administered at each 
(appendix).  Household  occupants  who

provided samples and answered questionnaires provided 
written consent.

Microbiological testing
All rectal swabs and fresh faecal samples were placed in 
Amies transport media, and transported on ice to one of 
two  laboratories  (Kenya  Medical  Research  Institute  or 
University  of  Nairobi  [UoN]).  Boot  socks  (on  which 
surface  material  from  livestock  pens  and  the  external 
environment were collected) and modified Moore swabs 
were  transported  in  saline-filled  polythene  bags,

and 
water samples were transported in conical tubes, all on 
ice. Samples were enriched in buffered peptone water for 
24  h,  and  then  plated  onto  eosin  methylene  blue  agar 
(EMBA)  and  incubated  for  24  h  at  37°C.  Subsequently, 
five  colonies  were  selected  and  subcultured  on  EMBA, 
before being further subcultured on Müller-Hinton agar 
and  stored  at  –20°C  in  cryovials.  A  single  colony  was 
picked at random from the plate for each original sample

A single colony was picked from each avian or bat pooled

to  determine  human 
breakpoints  for  classifying  isolates  as  sensitive,  inter-
mediate,  or  resistant  to  the  drug.13  Following  previous 
studies, intermediate strains were deemed to be moving 
towards resistance, and thus considered resistant on an 
evolutionary  basis.17,18  All  protocols  were

between  laboratories,  and  between-laboratory  quality 
control was done at regular intervals. Multidrug-resistant 
E  coli  was  defined  as  “non-susceptibility  to  at  least  one 
agent in three or more antimicrobial classes”17 (appendix). 
Wildlife  isolates  were  also  assessed  for  high  levels  of 
multidrug resistance (non-susceptibility to at least seven 
antimicrobial  classes  tested)  and  resistance  to  all 
antibiotics  tested  for  in  this  study.  An

antibiogram  was 
defined  as  the  combination  of  antibiotics  to  which  an 
isolate  was  resistant,  and  thus  antibiogram  length  was 
defined as the number of antibiotics to which an isolate 
was phenotypically resistant.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were done using R, version 3.3.2. 
Spatial  structure  in  the  dataset  was  represented  using 
distance-based  Moran’s  eigenvector  maps—a  powerful 
multivariate  approach  to  model  spatial  structure  in  a

response  variable,  which  can  be  partitioned  at  broad, 
medium, and fine spatial scales.19,20 Further details of how 
we  dealt  with  missing  data,  data  exploration,  and 
statistical  models  (distributions,  choice  of  fixed  and 
random  effects,  implementation,  and  model  selection 
procedures) are given in the appendix.

resistance  to  13  antibiotics  was  compared  between  all

were

city. To assess how antibiogram diversity was distributed 
across  compartments,  antibiogram  diversity  was  com-
pared using four ecological measures of diversity related 
to  Rényi’s  measures  of  generalised  entropy.23  Methods

behaviour  of  wildlife.  All  anthropogenic  and  ecological 
variables  were  derived  from  metadata  collected  within 
households,  and  published  sources  (appendix).  The 
laboratory in which samples were tested was included as 
a confounding factor in these models.

Results
Samples  were  collected  from  547  individual  birds, 
nine  avian  populations  (31  pooled  samples  across  nine 
populations),  167  rodents,  44  individual  bats,  five  bat 
populations (20 pooled samples across nine populations), 
five carnivores, and four primates

across 100 house holds, 
as  well  as  from  11  abattoirs  in  Nairobi,  between 
Sept  6,  2015,  and  Sept  28,  2016.  Antimicrobial  sus-
ceptibility  tests  were  done  on  a  single  E  coli  isolate 
cultured from 282 (52%) of 547 birds, 20 (65%) of 31 avian 
populations,  155  (93%)  of  167  rodents,  22  (50%)  of 
44  bats,  six  (22%)  of  27  bat  populations,  three  (60%)  of 
five  carnivores,  and  four  (100%)  of  four  primates. 
Because of low sample numbers, primates and

all  further  analysis.  E  coli  was  isolated  from,  and 
antimicrobial susceptibility tests done on, 638 livestock, 
321 human, and 256 environmental samples. 252 (52%)

We  show  that  urban  wildlife  species  are  important 
components  of  the  environmental  pool  of  resistance  to 
clinically relevant antimicrobials, and through exposure 
mediated by resource provisioning, could be involved in 
disseminating  clinically  relevant  resistance  across 
landscapes (appendix). Unlike most previous studies on

If wildlife exposure to antimicrobial resistance is largely

wildlife  that  frequent  high-risk  urban  environmental 
interfaces (where the accumulation of antibiotic residues 
or other coselecting agents, such as heavy metals, might 
force  the  accelerated  evolution  and  fixing  of  resistance 
determinants) could be an efficient way to detect clinically 
important

determinants  of  resistance.  To  explore 
the  practicality  of  surveillance  in  wildlife,  the  sampling 
effort  required  to  detect  different  fractions  of  the  total 
estimated 
richness  was 
calculated (figure 2; appendix). To detect all 273 predicted 
antibiograms  in  the  wildlife  species  sampled  would 
require  an  extra  8848  samples,  an  impractical  and 
expensive  task.  However,  detecting  85%  of  the  total 
diversity  would  require  a  disproportionately 
lower

sampling  effort  of  1572  samples.  Assuming  that  the 
diversity of antibiograms in selected wildlife is lower than 
the total diversity represented by all taxonomic classes of 
wildlife  included  in  this  study,  the  required  sampling 
effort to achieve an acceptable likelihood of detecting new 
antibiograms  in  these  species  would  be  much  lower. 
Extending this approach to livestock and humans reveals 
similar  outcomes  for  surveillance  of  antibiograms  in 
these

compartments (figure 2), suggesting that practical 
and  economically  viable  surveillance  for  antimicrobial 
resistance  of  public  health  concern  in  urban  wildlife, 
livestock, and humans could be achieved through targeted 
longitudinal  surveillance,  designed  to  capture  a  high 
proportion of diversity at regular intervals.

Urban  ecosystems  with  high  levels  of  background

peripheral  ecosystems,  where  the  flow  of  water,  and 
movement  of  humans,  livestock,  and  wildlife  act  as 
vectors  for  dispersal.29  Although  little  is  known  about 
how  resistance  genes  are  carried  and  shed  by  wildlife 
species,11 previous studies reporting extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase E coli carriage in migratory wild birds, and 
carriage  of  bacteria  with  resistance  to  more  antibiotics

wildlife 
could have an important role in disseminating clinically 
relevant antimicrobial resistance across landscapes. Our 

finding  of  higher  levels  of  antimicrobial  resistance 
carriage  in  birds  (particularly  scavenging  birds  with 
large home ranges) than other species suggest that these 
species  could  disseminate  antimicrobial  resistance 
determinants  to  neighbouring  ecosystems—Nairobi  is

Such extreme differentiation within a single city shows

This  study  has  several 

limitations.  Although  the 
prevalence  of  resistance  to  individual  antibiotics  and 
multidrug-resistant  E  coli  carriage  in  wildlife  was  high, 
without  comparable  datasets  from  other  urban  or  rural 
settings it is difficult to say how unique these results are to 
Nairobi.  Studies  done  in  a  variety  of  urban  settings,  and

would  permit  examination  of  context-specific  differences 
in wildlife antimicrobial resistance carriage and exposure. 
Because  of  the  effort  required  to  sample  wildlife  of 
different  species  our  sample  size  was  small  for  cryptic 
taxonomic  and  functional  groups  (eg,  bats,  scavengers, 
and  frugivores  or  nectarivores).  In  addition,  by  only 
culturing a single isolate from each host, the

within-host 
diversity  of  antimicrobial-resistant  E  coli  was  not 
considered.  We  made  this  decision  as  a  necessary,  cost-
based  trade-off  between  microbiological  resolution  and 
sample size. However, the effects of restricted sample size 
would  only  act  to  increase  type  II  error  in  our  results 
(ie,  conservative  statistical  inference,  or  missed  signal  in 
the data), and are thus unlikely to affect the validity of our 
findings.  More  broadly,  our  focus  on

Using sewage for surveillance
of antimicrobial resistance
A global system would exploit metagenomic sequencing

and Mark E. J. Woolhouse2

 A ntimicrobial  resistance  (AMR),  a 

cross-cutting  and  increasing  threat 
to  global  health  (1–3),  is  a  complex 
problem with multiple and intercon-
nected drivers. Reliable surveillance 
data  that  accurately  describe  and 
characterize the global occurrence and dis-
tribution of
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
AMR are essential for tracking 
changes in resistance over time, setting na-
tional  and  global  priorities,  assessing  the 
impacts  of  interventions,  identifying  new 
kinds of resistance, and supporting inves-
tigation of (international) outbreaks of re-
sistant  pathogens.  AMR  surveillance  data 
can also inform development of treatment 
guidelines.  Yet  it  has  proven  difficult  to 
achieve these objectives on a global scale, 
and especially in low- and middle-income 
countries
----

(LMICs), largely because current 
surveillance  systems  deliver  data  that  are 
extremely  variable  in  quality  and  quan-
tity  and  highly  heterogeneous  in  terms 
of  which  population  is  sampled  (usually 
a  category  of  hospital  patients)  and  what 
drug-bug  combinations  are  included  (1). 
Here, we outline a plan for a global AMR 
surveillance  system  based  on  applying 
next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  to  hu-
man sewage that will be especially helpful

AMR surveillance, which is 
difficult to achieve in other ways, and will 
provide  an  affordable  surveillance  option 
in resource-poor settings.

NGS  is  a  powerful  technology  that  has 
transformed  the  health  data  landscape. 
Among  many  other  benefits,  it  has  drasti-
cally improved our ability to determine the 
presence  of  AMR  genes  (bacterial  genes 
known  to  confer  resistance  to  an  anti-
microbial  drug)  in  single  isolates  and  to 
quantify them in complex

their 
occurrence and abundance.

Increasing numbers of people globally are 
connected to sewage treatment systems (6) 
and,  as  recently  highlighted  by  the  World 
Bank  (3),  metagenomics-based,  near  real-
time quantification of AMR genes in sewage 
is a potentially useful surveillance tool even 
in  remote  locations  without  microbiology 
laboratories  (7).  Such  an  approach  could 
quickly plug current gaps in the geographic, 
population, and agent coverage of AMR sur-
veillance, 
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
especially  by  providing  data  on 
AMR  outside  hospitals  (90%  of  antibiotic 
usage  in  humans  occurs  outside  hospitals) 
(see the figure). It could also provide infor-
mation  on  environmental  transmission  in 
populations exposed to raw sewage.

CURRENT AMR SURVEILLANCE
The relevance of local and national surveil-
lance  of  AMR  to  inform  treatment  guide-
lines  and  intervention  strategies  has  been 
recognized  for  decades.  The  first  interna-
tional  AMR-surveillance 
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
program  was  The 
European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveil-
lance Network (EARS-Net), whose predeces-
sor (EARS) was launched in 1998. EARS-Net 
is  based  on  routine  clinical  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  data  from  clinical  laborato-
ries  reported  to  the  European  Centre  for 
Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (ECDC). 
Only data from invasive isolates (blood and 
cerebrospinal fluid) and for seven bacterial 
pathogens are included.

The  Global  Antimicrobial  Resistance
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
Surveillance System (GLASS) was launched 
in  October  2015  by  the  World  Health  Or-
ganization  (WHO)  to  support  its  global 
action  plan  on  AMR.  A  number  of  local 
WHO  surveillance  networks  had  already 
been established prior to GLASS, and AMR 
data  were  also  included  in  surveillance  of 
single  pathogens  such  as  Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. As 
of  January  2020,  GLASS  had  enrolled  90 
countries  covering  all  regions  (though  not
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
all have yet provided data), each reporting 
on  up  to  eight  different  pathogens  and  up 

Published by AAAS

to  35  drug-bug  combinations  considered 
the most clinically important (though often 
only  a  small  subset  of  these).  In  addition 
to these formal systems, a number of more 
informal AMR surveillance initiatives have 
been  established,  such  as  ResistanceOpen 
that provides online maps of the occurrence 
of four “super-bugs” worldwide, and Resis-
tanceMap that maps
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
resistance data for 12 
bacterial pathogens from 46 countries.

A common feature of all these initiatives 
is  that  they  focus  on  hospitalized  patients 
and mainly last-resort antimicrobial agents 
such  as  carbapenems  (used  after  other 
agents  have  proven  ineffective)  (see  the 
figure). This reflects the clinical perception 
that  resistance  to  last-resort  antibiotics  is 
most  critical  for  patients,  and  the  ease  of 
access to clinical diagnostic facilities, put in
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
place to improve patient outcomes and not, 
primarily,  to  facilitate  AMR  surveillance. 
This  emphasis  on  clinical  settings  makes 
it  difficult  to  determine  the  global  spread 
of resistance to first-line drugs in the wider 
community, a large part of the global AMR 
burden (8). Indeed, it has recently been ar-
gued that interventions to support first-line 
drugs (e.g., tetracyclines) might have much 
greater  public  health  impact  than  against 
last-resort antimicrobial agents
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
(8), the ar-
gument  being  that  if  the  initial  treatment 
works,  the  patients  will  never  need  a  last-
resort antimicrobial treatment.

Because  current  isolate-based  surveil-
lance  greatly  relies  on  testing  already  be-
ing  conducted  for  clinical  purposes,  it  is 
often based on small sample sizes and can 
be  biased.  Nor  is  it  easily  implemented  in 
resource-poor  settings  where  there  are  no 
laboratories  to  perform  bacterial  isolation, 
identification, 
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
and  susceptibility  testing 
and  only  a  subset  of  the  population  may 
have  access  to  clinical  diagnostics.  In  ad-
dition, it has proven difficult to coordinate 
and harmonize both sampling and suscep-
tibility testing results: Different definitions 
for clinical cases may be used, methods for 
identification  differ,  and  different  antimi-
crobial agents are tested.

SEWAGE-BASED SURVEILLANCE
Examination of sewage inlets to treatment 
plants  is  already  recommended  for  polio

surveillance and, more recently, sewage has 
been  successfully  used  for  quantifying  the 
occurrence  and  abundance  of  AMR  genes 
in  human  populations  (4,  5,  9–11).  These 
studies mostly used metagenomic sequenc-
ing (which can detect all known resistance 
genes), though sometimes quantitative poly-
merase  chain  reaction  (which  targets  only 
selected genes). Even a single sample from 
one  site  can  be  representative  of  a  large, 
urban  population,  and  a  complete

some studies have suggested that
----

resistance 
data  from  sewage  can  correlate  well  with 
data from clinical surveillance (10, 11).

However,  global  sewage-based  surveil-
lance  using  metagenomics  differs  from 
conventional measures of levels and burden 
of  AMR  in  several  key  respects.  It  gener-
ates pooled data from a large, non–hospital 
population (whereas most surveillance data 
refer only to hospital patients). The data are 
also pooled across all bacteria taxa (i.e., do 
not  refer  to  a,  usually 
----
Source: science.aba3432.pdf
cultured,  subset  of  
bacterial pathogens). Sewage-based surveil-
lance measures AMR gene frequencies (not 
the  prevalence  of  phenotypic  resistance  in 
a  collection  of  isolates).  Sewage  therefore 
provides  a  different  measure  of  AMR  ob-
tained using a different sampling frame and 
as  such  can  augment  current  surveillance 
based on clinical isolates. Ideally, data from 
these two sources would be collected in par-
allel, allowing calibration and confirmation 
of geographic

like isolate-based surveillance, does not link 
the AMR genes to specific bacterial species 
(though  it  can  be  argued  that  for  surveil-
lance purposes, it is the genes that are of in-
terest). Also, sensitivity is likely lower than 
isolate-based surveillance (though this may 
be compensated for by not being limited to 
a few bacterial species).

At  the  same  time,  however,

sewage-
based metagenomic AMR surveillance has 
several  important  advantages.  It  charac-
terizes  large  communities  that  are  not 
routinely assessed by conventional surveil-
lance (though only those connected to the 
sewage  system).  It  is  straightforward  to 
implement,  at  its  most  basic  only  requir-
ing  sample  collection  (using  inexpensive 
equipment  that  is  readily  available)  and 
shipment.  Sequencing  and  bioinformatics

if  done  by  a  central  facility.  Ethical  con-
cerns have not been raised, and there is no 
legal requirement for informed consent as 
data cannot be linked to any individual (4). 
Sewage-based surveillance is not limited to 
an often very restricted subset of drug-bug 
combinations. It can provide a baseline for 
future  trends  and  to  monitor  the  effects

is  fully  standardized—ensuring  balanced 
representation  from  all  bacterial  species, 
maximizing  read  quality,  and  test  sensitiv-

for  generating  AMR  gene  abundance  data 
are already available (4) but, again, specific 
choices  need  to  be  made.  Unlike  the

The medicinal macrofungus Inonotus obliquus widely utilized as folk medicine in Russia and Baltic

accumulation results in the S-nitrosylation of PAL and 4CL required for the synthesis 
of precursor phenylpropanoids and styrylpyrone synthase (SPS), integral to the production of 
styrylpyrone, inhibiting their activities. These enzymes are targeted for denitrosylation by Trx proteins, 
which restore their activity. Further, this Trx S-nitrosothiol (SNO) reductase activity was potentiated 
following S-nitrosylation of Trx proteins at a non-catalytic cysteine (Cys) residue. Intriguingly, this
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
process was counterbalanced by Trx denitrosylation, mediated by Trx-dependent transnitrosylation 
of GSNOR. Thus, unprecedented interplay between Trx and GSNOR oxidoreductases regulates the 
biosynthesis of styrylpyrone polyphenols in I. obliquus.

Phenylpropanoid-derived styrylpyrone polyphenols synthesized by the medicinal mushroom I. obliquus have 
been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of cancer, hypertension and various neurodegenerative disorders1.

product of phenylpropanoid production and the precursor for the synthe-

laboratory growth conditions, however, these molecules in the culture of producing fungi are typically present 
at low concentrations limiting their clinical utility. Thus, understanding the regulatory machinery that controls

Fungal interspecific interactions enhance the transient biosynthesis of defense-related phenylpropanoid-

the redox cue, nitric oxide (NO), is thought to be integral to this process4. Further, an elevated level of NO-driven 
S-nitrosylation, the addition of a NO moiety to a reactive protein cysteine (Cys) thiol to

ning the synthesis of these molecules is
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
required to scale up production of styrylpyrone polyphenols and thereby 
fully exploit their medicinal potential.

Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)9, 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL)10 and styrylpyrone synthase (SPS)11 are 
key enzymes in styrylpyrone biosynthesis. A recent study suggests that the coculture of I. obliquus and Phellinus 
morii promotes increased phenylpropanoid-related gene expression followed by a transient increase in the pro-
duction of styrylpyrone polyphenols4. Further,
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
coculture of these two fungi also triggers NO burst and the sub-
sequent S-nitrosylation of the key enzymes in styrylpyrone biosynthesis12. However, mechanistic insight into 
how this system might be regulated remains to be established. Protein-SNO formation has emerged as a major 
route for the transfer of NO bioactivity. Moreover, this redox-mediated, post-translational modification has been 
shown to be a key regulator of protein function in eukaryotes13. Interestingly, the activation of
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
phenylpropanoid 
metabolism in I. obliquus in response to biotic stress parallels that in plants, where attempted microbial infection 
triggers a rapid nitrosative burst of reactive nitrogen intermediates including NO, which has been shown to acti-
vate the expression of key genes integral to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, such as PAL14.

In order to function as a biologically relevant signalling mechanism, S-nitrosylation must be transient and 
hence reversible15 and mechanisms coordinating
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
this process have recently begun to emerge. Chief among 
these are the enzymes S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) and thioredoxin (Trx). GSNOR turns over 
S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a mobile reservoir of NO bioactivity, formed by the reaction of NO with the anti-
oxidant tripeptide, glutathione (GSH). GSNO can function as a natural NO donor and conversely, GSH can 
denitrosylate protein SNOs. Thus, NO, GSH, GSNO and S-nitrosylated proteins are in dynamic equilibrium5. 
The breakdown of
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
GSNO by GSNOR therefore indirectly reduces total protein S-nitrosylation5. In contrast, 
recent findings suggest that Trx may be able to mediate direct protein denitrosylation in combination with a 
NADPH-dependent TRX reductase in both animals and plants16,17. Further, this SNO reductase system enables 
discrimination between protein-SNO substrates, providing both specificity and reversibility16.

In I. obliquus, inhibiting TrxR activity resulted in enhanced GSNOR function followed by
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
increased formation 
of protein-SNOs and a reduction in accumulation of styrylpyrone polyphenols. In contrast, inhibition of GSNOR 
coincided with increased TrxR activity, reduced protein-SNOs and an increase in styrylpyrone polyphenols7. This 
data implies that GSNOR may curtail the denitrosylation capacity of the Trx system and consequently reduce the 
production of fungal styrylpyrone polyphenols following the nitrosative burst. However, the underlying mechanism 
remains to be uncovered.
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
Here we show that increasing NO levels promotes total cellular denitrosylation capacity by 
S-nitrosylating the non-catalytic Cys40 and Cys60 residues in either I. obliquus thioredoxin (IoTrx) 1 or IoTrx3, respec-
tively. Our findings suggest that GSNOR limits further increases in styrylpyrone biosynthesis by acting as a substrate for 
either IoTrx1 or IoTrx3 trans-nitrosylation, thus promoting NO removal and hence reduced activity of Trx enzymes.

Determines the Redox Status of Enzymes Involved in 
Styrylpyrone Biosynthesis. 
In order to explore the possible roles of these two oxidoredoxin proteins 
in regulating reversible S-nitrosylation of the enzymes involved in fungal styrylpyrone biosynthesis, we cocul-
tured I. obliquus and P. morii in the presence or absence of two distinct TrxR specific inhibitors, auranofin7 or 
1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)18. In a similar fashion, we employed two diverse GSNOR specific inhibitors

N602219 and mithramycin A7 to help us clarify how the activity of GSNOR and TrxR might affect the redox status 
of PAL, 4CL and SPS, and their subsequent catalytic activity.

We first tested the suitable concentration of inhibitors. We showed that auranofin (AUR) at 60 nm, DNCB at 
45 nm, N6022 at 20 nM and mithramycin A (Mit A) at 37 nM were the maximum tolerant concentrations that 
did not affect the accumulation of mycelial biomass (Fig. 1A). These concentrations were employed in further

experiments. For combining the obligatory labeling and pulldown steps in Biotin-Switch, we employed thio-
propyl sepharose beads, a thiol-reactive resin to enrich protein-SNOs (SNO resin assisted capture, SNO-RAC) 
to assess the formation of protein S-nitrosylation. Further, as a covalent disulfide linkage is formed between 
the SNO site and resin, it is more feasible for trypsinization and peptide labeling, subservient to mass spectro-
metric identification of SNO site20,21. The captured
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
protein-SNOs were identified by Western Blot using spe-
cific antibodies12. Coculture of I. obliquus and P. morii promoted S-nitrosylation of PAL (isoforms 1 and 2), 
4CL and SPS. Interestingly, addition of the GSNOR specific inhibitors, N6022 and Mit A reduced the level of 
S-nitrosylation status of these enzymes. In contrast, the TrxR specific inhibitors AUR and DNCB gave rise to 
increased S-nitrosylation of PAL, 4CL and SPS (Fig. 1B). Congruent with the changes of protein S-nitrosylation,
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
the catalytic activity of PAL, 4CL and SPS (Fig. 1C) and accumulation of styrylpyrone polyphenols increased in 
the presence of GSNOR inhibitors and declined in the presence of TrxR inhibitors (Fig. 1D). To further validate 
these findings, we also knocked down the genes encoding GSNOR and IoTrx1 using vectors pCIT and pCH 
(Supplemental Fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained in the knockdown mutants, where knockdown of gsnor 
increased the secretion of secondary metabolites to PDA medium

(Supplemental Fig. 2A) and production of total 
polyphenols (Supplemental Fig. 2B), reduced S-nitrosylation of PAL, 4CL and SPS (Supplemental Fig. 2C) and 
up-regulated enzymatic activity (Supplemental Fig. 2D). In contrast, knockdown of IoTrx1 reduced the growth 
rate of I. obliquus on PDA medium and the production of polyphenols increased S-nitrosylation of PAL, 4CL and 
SPS and decreased their activity (Supplemental Fig. 2). Collectively, these data imply that the two oxidoredoxins

both IoTrx1 and IoTrx3 to denitrosylate BSA-SNO, this natural NO donor might promote a redox-dependent 
post-translational modification of these enzymes. As Trx proteins have previously been reported to be 
S-nitrosylated5,16, we determined if the three IoTrxs could be subject to this modification. Indeed, SNO-RAC

analysis21 suggested that either IoTrx1 or IoTrx3 could be S-nitrosylated by GSNO (Fig. 2D). As GSNOR could 
reduce the ability of both IoTrx1 and IoTrx3 to denitrosylate BSA-SNO, we reasoned that this might occur via the 
ability of this protein to remove the covalently attached NO group from IoTrx1 or IoTrx3. To test this we added 
GSNOR to the three IoTrxs in the presence or absence of NADH and determined the SNO status of these Trx 
enzymes by SNO-RAC. Surprisingly, the presence of GSNOR

reversed the S-nitrosylation of both IoTrx1 and 
IoTrx3, but not IoTrx2. Interestingly, the absence of NADH did not result in an obvious reduction in the ability of 
GSNOR to remove NO from the two nitrosylated IoTrxs (Fig. 2D).

(Supplemental Fig. 3). We performed site-directed mutagenesis to change both Cys40 in IoTrx1 and Cys60 in 
IoTrx3 to serine to preclude SNO formation at these positions. In contrast to the wild-type proteins, both IoTrx1 
Cys40Ser and IoTrx3 Cys60Ser were not S-nitrosylated following exposure to GSNO, implying Cys40 in IoTrx1

SNO Reductase Activity of IoTrx1 and IoTrx3.  Next, we

determined if the presence of more cysteines in 
IoTrxs can further enhance their denitrosylation capacity. We reasoned that the cysteines located on the surface 
of Trx molecules are more likely to be combined by NO upon exposure to S-nitrosylating agents. According to 
the predicted 3D structures by Swiss-Model (Supplemental Fig. 4), we found that Glu51 and Ala56 in IoTrx1 
and Lys24 and Ser75 in IoTrx3 are solvent exposed and prone to be S-nitrosylated once replaced by cysteines. To 
this
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
end, we mutated these amino acids to conduct possible correlations between the number of cysteines and 
their denitrosylation capacity. The presence of two additional non-catalytic cysteines in IoTrx1 did not increase 
their ability to reduce either insulin or S-nitrosylated BSA relative to wild-type (Fig. 4A). Rather, IoTrx1 mutant 
enzyme was indistinguishable from wild-type with respect to its ability to reduce insulin (Fig. 4A) or SNO-BSA 
(Fig. 4C). Interestingly, upon prior GSNO treatment
----
Source: srep37601.pdf
the reducing activity of the mutant IoTrx1 enzyme was 
impaired. In contrast, prior GSNO exposure enhanced insulin reducing activity in wild-type IoTrx1 (Fig. 4A). 
Further, SNO-RAC analysis showed that GSNO treatment of mutant IoTrx1 led to the formation of S-nitrosylated 
proteins with MW at 34 and 51 kDa. These SNO-proteins coincide with dimers or trimers of IoTrx1 (Fig. 4D). 
Similar scenario was also seen in IoTrx3 mutant, where the replacement of Lys24 and Ser75 by cysteine resulted 
in

Source: srep37601.pdf
the reduction in reducing insulin and denitrosylase activity upon treatment of GSNO (Fig. 4B,C,D). Thus, 
increasing the number of non-catalytic cysteines did not affect the ability of Trx enzymes to reduce disulphide 
bonds within an insulin turbidity assay. Moreover, these mutants exhibited decreased denitrosylation activity 
toward BSA-SNO following prior exposure to GSNO. Conversely, prior GSNO treatment of wild-type IoTrx1 and 
IoTrx3 resulted in a striking increase in denitrosylase

number of Cys residues in Trx proteins does not enhance their ability to function as a SNO reductase.

each Trx. To initiate these experiments, the DTT-treated GSNOR was mixed with GSNO-treated immobilized

detected in the flow-through in the absence of DTT, which suggests that both IoTrx1 and IoTrx3 functioned 
as a trans-nitrosylase, leading to the formation of S-nitrosylated GSNOR. This was confirmed by the eluates 
in the presence of DTT, where the reduction of GSNOR and the presence of free Trxs were observed (Fig. 5B).

cysteine residue in the predicted Swiss-Model (Supplemental Fig. 5B). To further confirm the S-nitrosylation site 
in GSNOR, we also mutated Cys135 to Ser and conducted the

GSNO by GSNOR, we used CysNO as nitrosylating agent. As might be expected, mutation of Cys135 abolished

To identify if the function of the two potential IoTrx nitrosylases might contribute to the formation of 
GSNOR-SNO in coculture, we also created IoTrx1 and IoTrx3 knockdown mutants. Significantly, knockdown of 
IoTrx1 reduced the formation of GSNOR-SNO generation (Fig. 7A) and the production of polyphenols (Fig. 7B). 
However, knockdown of

IoTrx3, which is expressed only at low levels during coculture, did not affect the forma-
tion of GSNOR-SNO and polyphenols (Fig. 7).

Another notable difference in the expression profiles of Trx proteins is the presence of IoTrx2 in a 
time-dependent pattern in coculture (Fig. 6A). To explore if IoTrx2 might contributes to Trx/GSNOR interplay, 
we created a IoTrx2 knockdown mutant. Knockdown of IoTrx2 resulted in an increased expression of IoTrx1, 
IoTrx3 (Supplemental Fig. 6A) and GSNOR

(Supplemental Fig. 6A), reduced formation of GSNOR-SNO (Supplemental Fig. 6B) and decreased production 
of polyphenols (Supplemental Fig. 6C) in coculture. In aggregate, this data implies that IoTrx2 cooperates with 
IoTrx1 in the reduction of protein-SNOs under nitrosative stress.

Arabidopsis, addition of highly reactive NO donors like NONOate and Cys-NO to wild-type leaf extracts 
triggered dose-dependent suppression of GSNOR1 activity29. Similar inhibitory examples were also seen in 
GSNORs from mammalian (human) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), where the binding of NO to the 
cysteines in GSNORs all led to their catalytic impairment30. In this study, we showed that the S-nitrosylated 
IoTrx1 is the major nitrosylase trans-nitrosylating the solvent exposed Cys135

in GSNOR via a physical inter-
action. Further, more extensive interaction between the two oxidoreductases leads to a transient increase in the 
formation of GSNOR-SNO, and consequently reduced denitrosylation activity of IoTrxs toward styrylpyrone 
synthetic enzymes, which coincides with diminished accumulation of styrylpyrone polyphenols (Fig. 6). Thus, 
NO mediated redox-regulation functions at multiple nodes of the regulatory machinery controlling fungal phe-
nylpropanoid biosynthesis.

recent discovery of protein-protein trans-nitrosylation reactions, the transfer of an NO group from one 
protein to another, has revealed a unique mechanism for targeted protein-SNO formation31 and conceivably could 
provide the basis for S-nitrosylation signaling cascades. To date, only a few examples of trans-nitrosylation have 
emerged, including between: hemoglobin and anion exchanger 1, thioredoxin and caspase-3, X-linked inhibi-
tor of apoptosis and caspase-3, GAPDH-DHAC2 and, Cdk5 and

dynamin related protein 117,32–35. Our findings  
suggesting that IoTrx1 and IoTrx3 can trans-nitrosylate GSNOR expands this list beyond human proteins and 
further establishes these enzymes as nitrosylases.

Sepharose beads followed by trypsin digestion and elution of resin-captured peptides from IoTrxs or GSNOR in 
the absence or presence of 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The flow-throughs were subject to LC-MS/MS for iden-

ABSTRACT: With the advent of antimicrobial resistance, there is an urgent
need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases. Antimicrobial peptides are
considered as promising candidates, and therefore
----

there is a need to understand
their mechanism of action in order to exploit their therapeutic potential. To this
end, ﬂuorescent analogs are powerful tools to analyze their behavior and
subcellular localization in cells and in vivo. However,
the conjugation of
ﬂuorophores to antimicrobial peptides, especially in short sequences, can impair
their biological activity, making the selection of the ﬂuorescent label an essential
step in these studies. In the present work, we have systematically

modiﬁed a
model antifungal hexapeptide with a collection of ﬂuorophores covering broad
physicochemical and spectral properties. The resulting conjugates have been
examined in two diﬀerent

intracellular localization. The biological results conﬁrm the inﬂuence of the
diﬀerent ﬂuorescent moieties on the subcellular localization of antimicrobial

■ INTRODUCTION

In the past decades, ﬂuorescent dyes have been broadly used as
tags to visualize and study the roles of peptides in cells and in
vivo.1 For these studies,
imaging has become the
live cell
technology of choice as it provides a direct readout of the
localization of the peptides with high spatial and temporal
resolution. In the context of antimicrobial
----
Source: zhao-et-al-2016-searching-for-the-optimal-fluorophore-to-label-antimicrobial-peptides.pdf
peptides, several
reports have described ﬂuorescence labeling as an approach to
study their mechanism of action,2−4 as well as to develop
imaging probes for the rapid identiﬁcation of microbes at
infection sites.5
is often assumed that
ﬂuorescently labeled peptides faithfully mimic the spatiotem-
poral dynamics of the native peptides, and ﬂuorescent labels are
typically chosen on the basis of excitation/emission wavelength,
quantum yield, photobleaching, environmental sensitivity or
chemical

conjugation. Little attention has been paid to whether
the ﬂuorescent label might alter the physicochemical properties
of the conjugate, and it is often unclear whether the ﬂuorescent
tag inﬂuences the uptake and localization of antimicrobial
peptides inside living cells. In order to evaluate the impact that
diﬀerent ﬂuorophores have in the biological properties of

conjugates based on
the Peptide Antifungal 26 (PAF26).6 This rationally designed
hexapeptide exhibits high potency against ﬁlamentous fungi
(including human and crop pathogens),
low toxicity against
bacterial cells and negligible toxicity against mammalian cells.
PAF26 is currently being used a model peptide for the
characterization of the mode-of-action of small, cationic, cell
penetrating antifungal peptides and for
the design and
development of synthetic antifungal peptides with

improved
properties for therapeutic uses.7

In the present work, we have conjugated 12 diﬀerent
ﬂuorophores (either in-house or commercially available) to the
peptide sequence of PAF26 and compared their biological
activity, cellular uptake and intracellular
localization using
confocal live cell imaging. From these studies, we have observed
that the activity of the conjugates is practically unaﬀected by the

the synthesis of
antimicrobial peptides has been adapted to combinatorial

the peptide

or pathogens,
or to reduce their cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.8−10 Some
antimicrobial peptides have been labeled with ﬂuorophores to
visualize their localization in cells by confocal microscopy.4,11
More recently, the high selectivity of antimicrobial sequences
has been exploited to develop imaging contrast agents for the
rapid identiﬁcation of infection sites.12,13 In most reports, only
one ﬂuorophore is employed on the basis of its compatibility
with the experimental procedures. However,

localization properties of peptide sequences. For instance,
Baker et al. reported the inﬂuence of diﬀerent ﬂuorescent labels
in a combinatorial library of A1R adenosine inhibitors, where
signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the binding properties
of several ﬂuorescently labeled inhibitors.16

In the context of
there are no reports of any
short antimicrobial peptides,

systematic evaluation of
conjugation to various ﬂuorescent
labels. Herein, we have
designed a library based on the antimicrobial peptide sequence
PAF26, which was modiﬁed with a total of 12 ﬂuorophores
covering the whole spectral range (from blue to near-infrared
emission) and diverse physicochemical properties (Chart 1). In
addition to conventional ﬂuorophores (e.g.,
----
Source: zhao-et-al-2016-searching-for-the-optimal-fluorophore-to-label-antimicrobial-peptides.pdf
carboxyﬂuorescein,
carboxyrhodamine, BODIPY, cyanine), we also included small
ﬂuorophores (e.g., NBD, dansyl), compounds with environ-
mentally sensitive properties (e.g., Nile Blue, malachite green,
styryl), pH-sensitivity (e.g., naphthalimide) and esterase-
activatable ﬂuorophores (e.g., ﬂuorescein diacetate). Overall,
these ﬂuorophores constitute a representative collection of the
ﬂuorescent labels that most chemists would employ for labeling
any deﬁned peptide sequence.

PAF26

(H-RKKWFW-NH2) is a short antimicrobial peptide
which, like many other antimicrobial peptides, contains both
cationic and hydrophobic residues,6,7 and therefore it is an
excellent model for examining the inﬂuence of ﬂuorophores in
the properties of antimicrobial peptides. We designed the

aThe peptide sequence of PAF26 was modiﬁed with amino- or azidohexanoic spacers at the N-terminus to enable the conjugation of diﬀerent
ﬂuorophores, either by formation of amide bonds in solid-phase or by “click” chemistry in solution. All 12 conjugates PAF26-1 to PAF26-12 were
isolated in good yields and high purities. For the chemical structures of the ﬂuorophores 1−12, see Chart 1.

polystyrene resin (Scheme 1). In order
to incorporate suitable conjugation groups within the sequence
of PAF26, we ﬁrst synthesized two derivatives containing
aminohexanoic or azidohexanoic spacers directly attached to
the N-terminal group of PAF26. Through these spacers,
ﬂuorophores could be readily conjugated using their reactive
groups (i.e., carboxylic acids, chlorides, anhydrides, sulfonyl
chlorides or alkynes) without aﬀecting the main recognition
features of the antimicrobial peptide.

Most library members
were fully synthesized on solid support, including the coupling
of the ﬂuorophore, to render the ﬁnal ﬂuorescent PAF26
analogues upon acidic cleavage from the resin using reported
procedures.17 Due to the lability of the ﬂuorophores 11 and 12
(i.e., BODIPY and ﬂuorescein diacetate, respectively) to acidic
media, the corresponding derivatives PAF26-11 and PAF26-12
were prepared by 1,3-Huisgen dipolar cycloaddition using the
azido-modiﬁed PAF26 and the ﬂuorescent alkynes in

phase (Scheme 1). All 12 ﬂuorescent derivatives of PAF26 were
puriﬁed by semipreparative HPLC to isolate the ﬁnal
conjugates (PAF26-1 to PAF26-12) in high purities (for
characterization data, see Supporting Information).

corroborate the minor inﬂuence of the ﬂuorescence labels on

and observed that both conjugates displayed a similar pattern of
cellular uptake, ﬁrst appearing in small vesicles and then
accumulating in larger cell vacuoles (Figure S2).

including small ﬂuorophores, such as NBD
(PAF26-3) or naphthalimide (PAF26-4), displayed similar
intracellular vacuolar/vesicular localization, both in conidial
germlings of N. crassa and A. f umigatus (Figure S3). Notably,
the pH-sensitive properties of PAF26-4 enabled preferential
imaging of acidiﬁed vacuoles as opposed to the general vacuolar
and vesicular structures staining observed with PAF26-1
(Figure S4), demonstrating the possibility of monitoring
intracellular pH

Conjugates including environmentally sensitive ﬂuorophores
such as malachite green, Nile Blue or dansyl (PAF26-5,
PAF26-6, and PAF26-7) showed marginal staining in fungal
cells, suggesting the potential accumulation of these peptide
conjugates in neutral hydrophilic microenvironments (e.g.,
in which these ﬂuorophores exhibit very low
vacuoles),

On the other hand, cationic styryl-based ﬂuorophores

stained the plasma and intracellular vacuolar/vesicular mem-
branes of N. crassa to a similar extent than PAF26-1 (Figure 1),
but without marked accumulation in the vacuole lumens.
Imaging experiments using the PAF26-9 derivative also showed
a similar behavior in both N. crassa and A. f umigatus (Figure
S5). As observed for PAF26-1, the cationic character of the
styryl ﬂuorophores favored the rapid interaction with

anionic
components of the cellular membranes and enhanced their
internalization (Table 1). Interestingly, and in contrast to the
results obtained with N. crassa (Figure 1), when we incubated
PAF26-8 with A. f umigatus, we did not observe the uptake of
the ﬂuorescent conjugate into healthy cells and hyphae were
only stained once the cell membrane structure was compro-
mised (Figure S6 and Movie S1). These results highlight
diﬀerences in the internalization of PAF26-8 by cells of
diﬀerent

Finally, both cyanine and BODIPY-based conjugates
(PAF26-10 and PAF26-11, respectively) displayed a markedly
diﬀerent staining pattern when compared to all other members
of the PAF26 library. The cyanine derivative (PAF26-10)

vacuoles and vesicle lumens, it also stained other cytoplasmic
labeling experiments with the carboxyﬂuor-
organelles. Dual
escein derivative PAF26-2 conﬁrmed the presence of PAF26-
10 in the same vacuolar and vesicular organelles but also
indicated its localization in diﬀerent cytoplasmic organelles
(Figure 2). The BODIPY derivative PAF26-11 exhibited

agreement with previous reports of cyanine-labeled peptides for

Altogether,

the systematic evaluation of a library of
ﬂuorescent PAF26-based antimicrobial peptides provides
important clues of the optimal ﬂuorophores for the preparation
of ﬂuorescent peptides and their application in bioimaging
experiments. Whereas positively charged structures (e.g.,
rhodamine, styryl) favor
the interaction with the anionic
membrane components, neutral (e.g., NBD) and negatively
charged ﬂuorophores (e.g., ﬂuorescein) preferentially accumu-
late in

Source: zhao-et-al-2016-searching-for-the-optimal-fluorophore-to-label-antimicrobial-peptides.pdf
vacuoles, and pH-sensitive ﬂuorophores (e.g., naph-
thalimide) oﬀer the possibility of visualizing speciﬁc intra-
cellular processes in real time, such as vacuolar acidiﬁcation.
Cell permeable ﬂuorophores (e.g., cyanine) provide bright
cytosolic staining and show good discrimination from back-
ground signals in whole-body in vivo ﬂuorescence imaging.
These results suggest that, whereas the PAF26 sequence is the
main component responsible for the antifungal activity of the
ﬂuorescent peptides,
----

the incorporation of diﬀerent ﬂuorescent
moieties into antimicrobial sequences can lead to major
redistributions of the peptide sequences to diﬀerent subcellular
environments.

upon incubation with PAF26-10 (Figure 2A) and its

we assessed the suitability of PAF26-10 for whole-body in vivo
ﬂuorescence imaging experiments in mice with fungal

manually
synthesized in polystyrene syringes ﬁtted with a polyethylene porous
disc using Fmoc-based SPPS. Solvents and soluble reagents were
removed by suction. The Fmoc group was removed with piperidine/
DMF (1:4) (1 × 1 min, 2 × 10 min). Peptide synthesis
transformations and washings were performed at r.t. For peptide
elongation, after the Fmoc group was removed, resins were washed
with DMF (4 × 1 min), DCM (3 × 1 min), and DMF (4 × 1 min).
Unless otherwise noted, standard coupling procedures
----
Source: zhao-et-al-2016-searching-for-the-optimal-fluorophore-to-label-antimicrobial-peptides.pdf
were used with
DIC (3 equiv) and OxymaPure (3 equiv) in DMF for 1−2 h and 5
min of preactivation. The completion of the coupling was monitored
by the Kaiser test.33 Then, resins were ﬁltered and washed with DCM
(4 × 1 min) and DMF (4 × 1 min).

were used. For compounds PAF26-3, PAF26-4, and PAF26-7,
coupling of the dyes was accomplished by incubation of the peptide
with the ﬂuorophore (3 equiv) and DIPEA (3 equiv) in DMF. All
resins were then washed with DMF (4 × 1 min) and DCM (3 × 1
min). For the cleavages, resins were stirred in 5 mL of TFA: H2O
(95:5) for 2 h at r.t. as previously reported.34 The beads were washed
with TFA thoroughly and the peptides precipitated with ice-cold Et2O

buﬀer saline (PBS) and spectra were recorded at r.t.

Culturing of N. crassa and A. f umigatus. Cultures of N. crassa
(wild type strain no. 2489 from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center)
and A. f umigatus (CEA10 strain from the fungal stock collection of the
Manchester Fungal Infection Group) were grown on solid 100%

were then harvested from the plates with sterile deionized water (N.
crassa) or 0.05% Tween 80 in sterile deionized water (A. fumigatus),
and the spore density was determined with a hemocytometer.

Antifungal Activity Measurements. The BacTiter-Glo Micro-
bial Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega), with CELLSTAR white
polystyrene ﬂat bottomed 96-well plates (Greiner), were used for these
assays. Each antifungal peptide, at an

reach a ﬁnal volume of 100 μL per well and a ﬁnal conidial
concentration of 5 × 105 cells/mL in 10% liquid Vogel’s medium.
After 24 h of incubation (at 25 °C for N. crassa or 37 °C for A.

White light (450−750 nm), argon ion (458, 476, 488, and 496 nm)
and blue diode lasers (405 nm) were used for excitation. Images were
processed and analyzed using Imaris 3D/4D image processing and
analysis software, version 8.0 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Details
on the excitation and emission wavelengths used for the PAF26-1/12
conjugates are shown in Table S2.

infection, whole-body ﬂuorescence imaging was carried out under
isoﬂurane anesthesia on an IVIS Spectrum system with Living Image
software (version 4.5.2, PerkinElmer). The ﬂuorescence signal
intensity was measured using the excitation/emission 640/680 ﬁlter
pair before and 5 min after intratracheal administration of 7.5 nmol of
the PAF26-10 derivative.
