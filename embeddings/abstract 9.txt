route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). Total cellular levels of protein S-nitrosylation are controlled predominantly by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (GSNOR1) which turns over the natural NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In the absence of GSNOR1 function, GSNO accumulates, leading to dysregulation of total cellular S-nitrosylation.

used 19F NMR as an in situ, non-invasive technique for measuring the composition of a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) of N-acylhydrazones (NAHs). An NAH DCL, constructed from a fluoro-aromatic aldehyde and a small set of hydrazides, was targetted at ecFabH, an essential enzyme in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Our NMR analysis identified a tert-butyl NAH as the best binder which was confirmed by enzymatic assay.

deficiency viruses infecting western lowland gorillas (SIVgor) are closely related to HIV-1 and are most likely the ancestors of HIV-1 groups O and P. At present, limited data are available on genetic diversity, transmission, viral evolution, and pathogenicity of SIVgor in its natural host. Between 2004 and 2011, 961 putative gorilla fecal samples were collected at the Campo Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. Among them, 16% cross-reacted with HIV-1 antibodies, corresponding to at least 34 infected gorillas.

Abstract: The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary 'arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi.

Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36% and 26% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D.

We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D.

n Abstract: With the problem of parasitic nematode drug resistance increasing, vaccine development offers an alternative sustainable control approach. For some parasitic nematodes, native extracts enriched for specific proteins are highly protective. However, recombinant forms of these proteins have failed to replicate this protection. This is thought to be due to differences in glycosylation and/or conformation between native and recombinant proteins.

Sexual development has been studied in detail, revealing genes required for perithecium formation and ascospore germination. However, the germination process per se has not yet been examined.

Here I analyze nuclear dynamics during ascospore germination using a fluorescently labeled histone. Live-cell imaging revealed that nuclei are transported into germination vesicles that form on one side of the spore. Polar growth is established from these vesicles.

PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types.

PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis.

sed both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation, we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation.

The antiviral activity of 5-15b was doseand time-dependent but was independent of the cell substrate and multiplicity of infection used. Importantly, inhibition of influenza A and B viruses required S-ONs reproducing the respective packaging signals. Furthermore, 5-15b and its antisense derivative S-ON activity did not affect intracellular accumulation of viral RNA.

TbGPR89 is expressed on bloodstream "slender form" trypanosomes, which receive the SIF signal, and when ectopically expressed, TbGPR89 drives stumpy formation in a SIF-pathway-dependent process.

We describe how these fragile surfaces can be mounted in a rotating disk configuration so that enzyme mass transfer no longer limits the overall measured cleavage kinetics.

Origins and Evolutionary Dynamics of H3N2 Canine Influenza Virus. 2015 May Authors: Henan Zhu, Joseph Hughes, Pablo R Murcia Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand.

s (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages.

We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission.

However, no related swine viruses have been detected in Mexico or any part of the Americas, and to date the most closely related ancestor viruses were identified in Asian swine.

With AFE as a covariate, additional QTL for body WFE were found on chromosomes 1 and 13, with abdominal fat pad as covariate a QTL for body WFE was found on chromosome 1.

With body WFE as covariate, additional QTL for AFE were found on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 13 and 27. The QTL generally acted additively and there was no evidence for epistasis. Consistent with the original line differences, broiler alleles had positive effects on body WFE and negative effects on AFE, whereas the phenotypic correlation between the two traits was positive.

The mapped QTL for body WFE cumulatively accounted for almost half the body weight difference between the chicken lines at puberty. Overlapping QTL for body WFE and body weight to 9 weeks of age indicate that most QTL affecting growth rate also affect body WFE.

Because CATT-negative individuals are rarely examined further, the general prevalence of parasitologically positive but CATT-negative cases is unclear. This study demonstrates the value of co-ordinated use of serological and parasitological techniques in the diagnosis of Gambian sleeping sickness.

udies on biological macromolecules in a solvent-free environment. Collision cross sections (CCSs) measured by IM-MS provide a measure of analyte size. For native proteins and their complexes, many structural features can be preserved in the gas phase, making IM-MS a powerful approach for a range of bioanalytical applications. In addition to tightly folded conformers, a large number of partially disordered proteins participate in biological processes and disease mechanisms.

In addition to tightly folded conformers, a large number of partially disordered proteins participate in biological processes and disease mechanisms. It remains unclear to what extent IM-MS is suitable for exploring structural properties of these semifolded species. The current work addresses this question, using myoglobin as model system. This protein follows a sequential unfolding pathway that comprises two partially disordered states, i.e., apo-myoglobin (aMb) at pH 7 and pH 4.

IM-MS data acquired for these two conformers were compared to those of native holo-myoglobin (hMb) at pH 7 and extensively unfolded aMb at pH 2. When examining individual aMb charge states, the degree of gas phase unfolding is not strongly correlated with the corresponding solution behavior.

2. When examining individual aMb charge states, the degree of gas phase unfolding is not strongly correlated with the corresponding solution behavior. A key problem is that non-native conformers generate high ESI charge states, resulting in conformational transitions caused by intramolecular electrostatic repulsion. It is possible to establish a link between solution phase and gas phase structure when normalizing CCS distributions according to their respective ESI-MS signal intensities.

This approach yields CCS averages that follow the expected progression hMbpH 7 < aMbpH 7 < aMbpH 4 < aMbpH 2. However, this trend mainly reflects the protonation behavior of the conformers during the ESI process, rather than a genuine memory of solution structure.

We also reported that the presence of pLL inhibited the activating phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) effector Akt induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-4. We now show that the inhibitory effect of pLL extends to LPS as a PI3K activator, and results in diminished phosphorylation of GSK3 downstream from Akt.

Functionally, the inhibition of Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation are linked to the blunted upregulation of CD40, a major feature of the unconventional maturation phenotype. Paradoxically, all aspects of unconventional maturation induced by pLL depend on PI3K class I. Additional components of the phagocytic machinery are needed, but phagocytosis of pLL particles is not required.

It is believed that antibodies against PfEMP1 confer protection by blocking sequestration (rosetting and cytoadherence), inducing antibody-dependent cellular-inhibitory effect and opsonizing pRBCs for phagocytosis.

s Concepci√≥n, Wilfredo Qui√±ones Abstract: Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a glycolytic enzyme that is well conserved among the three domains of life. PGK is usually a monomeric enzyme of about 45 kDa that catalyses one of the two ATP-producing reactions in the glycolytic pathway, through the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPGA) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). It also participates in gluconeogenesis, catalysing the opposite reaction to produce 1,3BPGA and ADP.

Like most other glycolytic enzymes, PGK has also been catalogued as a moonlighting protein, due to its involvement in different functions not associated with energy metabolism, which include pathogenesis, interaction with nucleic acids, tumorigenesis progression, cell death and viral replication.

The resulting phylogenetic tree identifies 12 classes of sequences, each possessing a characteristic set of sequence fingerprints for the catalytic loops. From this analysis it is now possible to assign the mycobacterial thiolases to corresponding homologues in other kingdoms of life.

dium falciparum adhesin PfRh4 binds to complement receptor type-1 (CR1) on human erythrocytes and mediates a glycophorin-independent invasion pathway. CR1 is a complement regulator and immune-adherence receptor on erythrocytes required for shuttling of C3b/C4b-opsonized particles to liver and spleen for phagocytosis. Using recombinant CR1 constructs, we mapped the recognition site for PfRh4 to complement control protein modules 1 to 3 (CCP1-3) at the membrane-distal amino terminus of CR1.

This region of CR1 binds to C4b and C3b and accelerates decay of both classic pathway and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases. CCP1-3 competed for PfRh4 binding to erythroid CR1 and inhibited the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathways across a wide range of P falciparum strains. PfRh4 did not bind significantly to other CR1 constructs, including CCP15-17, which is 85% identical to CCP1-3.

Positive expiratory pressure therapy versus other airway clearance techniques for bronchiectasis. 2017 Sep 27 Authors: Annemarie L Lee, Angela T Burge, Anne E Holland Abstract: People with bronchiectasis experience chronic cough and sputum production and require the prescription of airway clearance techniques (ACTs). A common type of ACT prescribed is positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy. A previous review has suggested that ACTs including PEP therapy are beneficial compared to no treatment in people with bronchiectasis.

The persistence of S. mansoni in Nder could raise concern as levels of infection intensity remain high (geometric mean intensity at baseline 653epg changed to 705epg at 12 months) after four rounds of chemotherapy. This phenomenon could be explained by extremely rapid re-infection dynamics or a sub-optimal efficacy of praziquantel against S. mansoni in this village.

PS/gammaS processing of CD46 releases immunoprecipitable cyt1 and cyt2 tail peptides into the cell, is blocked by chemical inhibitors, and is prevented in dominant negative presenilin mutant cell lines.

The main reasons, aside from vaccinations, were dental disease, renal disease and lower urinary tract disorders in 1995, and dental disease, renal disease and hyperthyroidism in 2010-2015. All major diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently in 2010-2015 than in 1995; behavioural changes were variably associated with these diseases.

We also used a culture and pyrosequencing approach to genotype strains and infer their potential macrolide resistance. Of a total 9,431 tested samples from inand out-patient with RTI, 1,255 (13%) were found to be positive by M. pneumoniae PCR. The proportion of positive samples was 19% (947/5,092)among children (¬£16 years-old) and 7% (308/4,339) among adults (>16 years-old).

Overall, among those PCR tested, the highest proportions of M. pneumonia infections during the study period were observed in 2010 and 2014. In these two years, 18% (218/1,237) and 25% (721/2,844) of samples were positive respectively,indicating epidemic periods. From the 1,255 M. pneumoniae PCR-positive samples, 783 (614 from paediatric and 169 from adult patients) were successfully cultured.

This individual was heterozygous (MV) at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP), whereas all previous definite and probable cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been methionine homozygotes (MM).

We have therefore initiated studies on the immune response of the crustacean Daphnia when exposed to the specialist endobacterial pathogen, Pasteuria ramosa. This study was focused on the proPO gene of Daphnia magna. D. magna possesses a single copy of proPO (as does its congener, D. pulex), but there was some evidence of alternative splicing.

Analyses of sequence similarity in a range of arthropod taxa suggested that the proPO gene in Daphnia was as dissimilar to other crustaceans as it was to insects, while analysis on intraspecific variation indicated that the gene is highly conserved.

We found that the observed patterns of infection and antibody were most consistent with models in which a long-lived protective antibody response is stimulated by the death of adult S. haematobium worms and reduces worm fecundity. These findings are discussed with regard to current understanding of human immune responses to schistosome infection.

t: A missense C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism within PTPN22 is a strong genetic risk factor for the development of multiple autoimmune diseases. PTPN22 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates immuno-receptor proximal Src and Syk family kinases. Notably, PTPN22 negatively regulates kinases downstream of T-cell receptor (TCR) and LFA-1, thereby setting thresholds for T-cell activation.

Aggregated forms of PrP co-purify with prion infectivity, although infectivity does not always correlate with the presence of PrP27-30. This suggests that discrimination between PrPC (normal cellular PrP) and PrPSc by proteolysis may underestimate the repertoire and quantity of PrPSc subtypes.

Overexpression of PtrWRKY73 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in increased resistance to a virulent strain of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae (PstDC3000), but more sensitivity to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. The SA-mediated defense-associated genes, such as PR1, PR2 and PAD4, were markedly up-regulated in transgenic plants overexpressing PtrWRKY73.

Arabidopsis non-expressor of PR1 (NPR1) was not affected, whereas a defense-related gene PAL4 had reduced in PtrWRKY73 overexpressor plants. Together, these results indicated that PtrWRKY73 plays a positive role in plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens but a negative effect on resistance against necrotrophic pathogens.

We now address the contributions of IL-5, eotaxin-1, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the induction of disease-enhancing immune responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells during immunization prevented IL-4, IL-13, and eotaxin-1 production, diminished eosinophilia, and reduced weight loss.

Conversely, CD8+ T cell depletion did not decrease eosinophilia, weight loss, or type 2 cytokines but did dramatically reduce mucus production and increase eotaxin production. Anti-IL-5 administration at immunization or challenge significantly decreased pulmonary eosinophilia. Strikingly, there were not concomitant decreases in weight loss.

Following RSV challenge eotaxin-1-deficient mice immunized with vvGs exhibited significantly less eosinophilia without decreased weight loss or type 2 cytokine production. We conclude CD4+ T cell production of IL-5 and induction of eotaxin-1 are required for vvGs-induced eosinophilia following RSV challenge, while CD8+ T cells appear to down-regulate eotaxin-1 and mucus production.

In summary, we demonstrate that pulmonary eosinophilia 1) is a by-product of memory CD4+ T cell activation, 2) does not necessarily correlate with mucus production, and, most importantly, 3) is not required for the RSV G-induced illness in mice. These findings have important implications for the evaluation of candidate RSV vaccines.
