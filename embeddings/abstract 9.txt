route for the transfer of NO bioactivity is S-nitrosylation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine thiol forming an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). Total cellular levels of protein S-nitrosylation are controlled predominantly by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (GSNOR1) which turns over the natural NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In the absence of GSNOR1 function, GSNO accumulates, leading to dysregulation of total cellular S-nitrosylation.

An NAH DCL, constructed from a fluoro-aromatic aldehyde and a small set of hydrazides, was targetted at ecFabH, an essential enzyme in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Our NMR analysis identified a tert-butyl NAH as the best binder which was confirmed by enzymatic assay.

deficiency viruses infecting western lowland gorillas (SIVgor) are closely related to HIV-1 and are most likely the ancestors of HIV-1 groups O and P. At present, limited data are available on genetic diversity, transmission, viral evolution, and pathogenicity of SIVgor in its natural host. Between 2004 and 2011, 961 putative gorilla fecal samples were collected at the Campo Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. Among them, 16% cross-reacted with HIV-1 antibodies, corresponding to at least 34 infected gorillas.

Abstract: The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary 'arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi.

Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36% and 26% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D.

We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D.

n Abstract: With the problem of parasitic nematode drug resistance increasing, vaccine development offers an alternative sustainable control approach. For some parasitic nematodes, native extracts enriched for specific proteins are highly protective. However, recombinant forms of these proteins have failed to replicate this protection. This is thought to be due to differences in glycosylation and/or conformation between native and recombinant proteins.

PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types.

PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis.

sed both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation, we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation.

The antiviral activity of 5-15b was doseand time-dependent but was independent of the cell substrate and multiplicity of infection used. Importantly, inhibition of influenza A and B viruses required S-ONs reproducing the respective packaging signals. Furthermore, 5-15b and its antisense derivative S-ON activity did not affect intracellular accumulation of viral RNA.

TbGPR89 is expressed on bloodstream "slender form" trypanosomes, which receive the SIF signal, and when ectopically expressed, TbGPR89 drives stumpy formation in a SIF-pathway-dependent process. Structural modeling of TbGPR89 predicts unexpected similarity to oligopeptide transporters (POT), and when expressed in bacteria, TbGPR89 transports oligopeptides. Conversely, expression of an E.

Five commercially available RT-PCR kits were evaluated with the pan-HPeV and EV assays in one-step and two-step RT-PCRs. Two-step RT-PCR with the AgPath ID RT-PCR (AGP) kit performed best for both pan-HPeV and EV assays. The pan-HPeV-specific assay performed best with the AGP kit in a one-step RT-PCR.

We describe how these fragile surfaces can be mounted in a rotating disk configuration so that enzyme mass transfer no longer limits the overall measured cleavage kinetics. Finally, we demonstrate that, once the system has been optimized, in situ real-time cyclic voltammetry monitoring of the protease action can yield high-quality kinetic data, showing no sign of interfering effects.

Origins and Evolutionary Dynamics of H3N2 Canine Influenza Virus. 2015 May Authors: Henan Zhu, Joseph Hughes, Pablo R Murcia Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand.

s (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages.

2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission.

With body WFE as covariate, additional QTL for AFE were found on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 13 and 27. The QTL generally acted additively and there was no evidence for epistasis. Consistent with the original line differences, broiler alleles had positive effects on body WFE and negative effects on AFE, whereas the phenotypic correlation between the two traits was positive.

The mapped QTL for body WFE cumulatively accounted for almost half the body weight difference between the chicken lines at puberty. Overlapping QTL for body WFE and body weight to 9 weeks of age indicate that most QTL affecting growth rate also affect body WFE.

udies on biological macromolecules in a solvent-free environment. Collision cross sections (CCSs) measured by IM-MS provide a measure of analyte size. For native proteins and their complexes, many structural features can be preserved in the gas phase, making IM-MS a powerful approach for a range of bioanalytical applications. In addition to tightly folded conformers, a large number of partially disordered proteins participate in biological processes and disease mechanisms.

In addition to tightly folded conformers, a large number of partially disordered proteins participate in biological processes and disease mechanisms. It remains unclear to what extent IM-MS is suitable for exploring structural properties of these semifolded species. The current work addresses this question, using myoglobin as model system. This protein follows a sequential unfolding pathway that comprises two partially disordered states, i.e., apo-myoglobin (aMb) at pH 7 and pH 4.

ystem. This protein follows a sequential unfolding pathway that comprises two partially disordered states, i.e., apo-myoglobin (aMb) at pH 7 and pH 4. IM-MS data acquired for these two conformers were compared to those of native holo-myoglobin (hMb) at pH 7 and extensively unfolded aMb at pH 2. When examining individual aMb charge states, the degree of gas phase unfolding is not strongly correlated with the corresponding solution behavior.

2. When examining individual aMb charge states, the degree of gas phase unfolding is not strongly correlated with the corresponding solution behavior. A key problem is that non-native conformers generate high ESI charge states, resulting in conformational transitions caused by intramolecular electrostatic repulsion. It is possible to establish a link between solution phase and gas phase structure when normalizing CCS distributions according to their respective ESI-MS signal intensities.

lish a link between solution phase and gas phase structure when normalizing CCS distributions according to their respective ESI-MS signal intensities. This approach yields CCS averages that follow the expected progression hMbpH 7 < aMbpH 7 < aMbpH 4 < aMbpH 2. However, this trend mainly reflects the protonation behavior of the conformers during the ESI process, rather than a genuine memory of solution structure.

ver, this trend mainly reflects the protonation behavior of the conformers during the ESI process, rather than a genuine memory of solution structure. Overall, our data reveal that electrostatically driven expansion as well as collapse events can lead to disparities between gaseous and solution structures for partially unfolded proteins.

We also reported that the presence of pLL inhibited the activating phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) effector Akt induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-4. We now show that the inhibitory effect of pLL extends to LPS as a PI3K activator, and results in diminished phosphorylation of GSK3 downstream from Akt.

Functionally, the inhibition of Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation are linked to the blunted upregulation of CD40, a major feature of the unconventional maturation phenotype. Paradoxically, all aspects of unconventional maturation induced by pLL depend on PI3K class I. Additional components of the phagocytic machinery are needed, but phagocytosis of pLL particles is not required.

Graham Bell, Nick Colegrave, Peter D Keightley, Rob W Ness Abstract: The nature of population structure in microbial eukaryotes has long been debated. Competing models have argued that microbial species are either ubiquitous, with high dispersal and low rates of speciation, or that for many species gene flow between populations is limited, resulting in evolutionary histories similar to those of macroorganisms. However, population genomic approaches have seldom been applied to this question.

We focus on malaria (Plasmodium) parasites which exhibit developmental rhythms during replication in the mammalian host's blood and in transmission to vectors. Rhythmic in-host parasite replication is responsible for eliciting inflammatory responses, the severity of disease symptoms, and fueling transmission, as well as conferring tolerance to anti-parasite drugs.

Peripheral prion disease pathogenesis is unaltered in the absence of sialoadhesin (Siglec-1/CD169). 2014 Sep Authors: Barry M Bradford, Paul R Crocker, Neil A Mabbott Abstract: Prions are a unique group of pathogens, which are considered to comprise solely of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein. The accumulation and replication of prions within secondary lymphoid organs is important for their efficient spread from the periphery to the brain where they ultimately cause neurodegeneration and death.

We identified six major groups of gCJD based on the combination PrP<sup>Sc</sup> type and codon 129 genotype on PRNP mutated allele, each showing distinctive histopathological characteristics, irrespectively of the PRNP associated mutation. Five gCJD groups, named M1, M2C, M2T, V1, and V2, largely reproduced those previously described in sCJD subtypes.

A few isolated cases linked to rare PRNP haplotypes (e.g., T183A-129M), showed atypical phenotypic features, which prevented their classification into the six major groups.

s Concepción, Wilfredo Quiñones Abstract: Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a glycolytic enzyme that is well conserved among the three domains of life. PGK is usually a monomeric enzyme of about 45 kDa that catalyses one of the two ATP-producing reactions in the glycolytic pathway, through the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPGA) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). It also participates in gluconeogenesis, catalysing the opposite reaction to produce 1,3BPGA and ADP.

Like most other glycolytic enzymes, PGK has also been catalogued as a moonlighting protein, due to its involvement in different functions not associated with energy metabolism, which include pathogenesis, interaction with nucleic acids, tumorigenesis progression, cell death and viral replication.

Syncytiotrophoblast-derived microvesicles/microparticles (STBM) are larger microvesicles (0.2-2 mm) shed by the apical plasma membrane of the STB as a result of cell activation and turnover. Simultaneously with the STBM shedding, the STB produces and secretes exosomes--nanosized (30-100/150 nm) membrane-bound microvesicles that originate from the endosomal compartment.

ne Repeat Modular Proteins (PCRMP1-4) of Plasmodium, are encoded by a small gene family that is conserved in malaria and other Apicomplexan parasites. They are very large, predicted surface proteins with multipass transmembrane domains containing motifs that are conserved within families of cysteine-rich, predicted surface proteins in a range of unicellular eukaryotes, and a unique combination of protein-binding motifs, including a >100 kDa cysteine-rich modular region, an epidermal growth factor-like domain and a Kringle domain.

dium falciparum adhesin PfRh4 binds to complement receptor type-1 (CR1) on human erythrocytes and mediates a glycophorin-independent invasion pathway. CR1 is a complement regulator and immune-adherence receptor on erythrocytes required for shuttling of C3b/C4b-opsonized particles to liver and spleen for phagocytosis. Using recombinant CR1 constructs, we mapped the recognition site for PfRh4 to complement control protein modules 1 to 3 (CCP1-3) at the membrane-distal amino terminus of CR1.

This region of CR1 binds to C4b and C3b and accelerates decay of both classic pathway and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases. CCP1-3 competed for PfRh4 binding to erythroid CR1 and inhibited the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathways across a wide range of P falciparum strains. PfRh4 did not bind significantly to other CR1 constructs, including CCP15-17, which is 85% identical to CCP1-3.

located in the Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestine and are responsible for monitoring and transcytosis of antigens, microorganisms, and pathogens. Mature M cells use the receptor glycoprotein 2 (GP2) to aid in transcytosis. Recent studies have shown transcription factors, Spi-B and SRY-Box Transcription Factor 8 (Sox8). are necessary for M-cell differentiation, but not sufficient. An exhaustive set of factors sufficient for differentiation and development of a mature GP2+ M cell remains elusive.

PS/gammaS processing of CD46 releases immunoprecipitable cyt1 and cyt2 tail peptides into the cell, is blocked by chemical inhibitors, and is prevented in dominant negative presenilin mutant cell lines.

y at night (32%; 43.6%), and house-soiling (29.3%; 55.8%). Most (79.4%; 81%) of the cats had visited a veterinary surgeon since becoming 11 years old. The main reasons, aside from vaccinations, were dental disease, renal disease and lower urinary tract disorders in 1995, and dental disease, renal disease and hyperthyroidism in 2010-2015. All major diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently in 2010-2015 than in 1995; behavioural changes were variably associated with these diseases.

(4) Conclusion: elderly cats display age-related behavioural changes and develop diseases that may be under-diagnosed. Veterinarians need to ask owners about these behavioural changes, as they may signify manageable conditions rather than reflect "normal" ageing.

Results of a genotype analysis by year,showed that the dominant M. pneumoniae P1 type during the 2010 epidemic was P1 type II (82% of isolates;81/99), which was replaced by P1 type I in the 2014 epidemic (75%; 384/510). This observation could indicate that the two epidemics may have been driven by a type shift phenomenon, although both types remained present in the studied population during the assessed period of time.

Priorities for the elimination of sleeping sickness. 2012 Authors: Susan C Welburn, Ian Maudlin Abstract: Sleeping sickness describes two diseases, both fatal if left untreated: (i) Gambian sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a chronic disease with average infection lasting around 3 years, and (ii) Rhodesian sleeping sickness caused by T. b. rhodesiense, an acute disease with death occurring within weeks of infection.

ing around 3 years, and (ii) Rhodesian sleeping sickness caused by T. b. rhodesiense, an acute disease with death occurring within weeks of infection. Control of Gambian sleeping sickness is based on case detection and treatment involving serological screening, followed by diagnostic confirmation and staging. In stage I, patients can remain asymptomatic as trypanosomes multiply in tissues and body fluids; in stage II, trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the central nervous system and, if left untreated, death follows.

Direct investigation of cross-neutralization properties of HRV-C is precluded by the lack of methods for in vitro culture, but sequences from the capsid genes (VP1 and partial VP4/VP2) show evidence for marked phylogenetic clustering, suggesting the possibility of a genetically based system comparable to that used for the assignment of new enterovirus types.

We propose a threshold of 13% divergence for VP1 nucleotide sequences for type assignment, a level that classifies the current dataset of 86 HRV-C VP1 sequences into a total of 33 types. We recognize, however, that most HRV-C sequence data have been collected in the VP4/VP2 region (currently 701 sequences between positions 615 and 1043).

In agreement, we demonstrate that UPL3 enabled proteasomes to form polyubiquitin chains, thereby regulating total cellular polyubiquitination levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that proteasome-associated ubiquitin ligase activity of UPL3 promotes proteasomal processivity and is indispensable for development of plant immunity.

Aggregated forms of PrP co-purify with prion infectivity, although infectivity does not always correlate with the presence of PrP27-30. This suggests that discrimination between PrPC (normal cellular PrP) and PrPSc by proteolysis may underestimate the repertoire and quantity of PrPSc subtypes.

PCR and High Throughput Multi Locus Sequence Typing (HiMLST) were used for species identification and sequence typing. In total, 36.6% of 287 caecal samples (n = 105; 95% CI: 14-59.2) were Campylobacter positive.

ytial virus (RSV) challenge of vvGs-immunized mice. We have shown IL-4 and IL-13 activity must be simultaneously inhibited to reduce disease severity. We now address the contributions of IL-5, eotaxin-1, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the induction of disease-enhancing immune responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells during immunization prevented IL-4, IL-13, and eotaxin-1 production, diminished eosinophilia, and reduced weight loss.

nses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells during immunization prevented IL-4, IL-13, and eotaxin-1 production, diminished eosinophilia, and reduced weight loss. Conversely, CD8+ T cell depletion did not decrease eosinophilia, weight loss, or type 2 cytokines but did dramatically reduce mucus production and increase eotaxin production. Anti-IL-5 administration at immunization or challenge significantly decreased pulmonary eosinophilia. Strikingly, there were not concomitant decreases in weight loss.

stration at immunization or challenge significantly decreased pulmonary eosinophilia. Strikingly, there were not concomitant decreases in weight loss. Following RSV challenge eotaxin-1-deficient mice immunized with vvGs exhibited significantly less eosinophilia without decreased weight loss or type 2 cytokine production. We conclude CD4+ T cell production of IL-5 and induction of eotaxin-1 are required for vvGs-induced eosinophilia following RSV challenge, while CD8+ T cells appear to down-regulate eotaxin-1 and mucus production.

In summary, we demonstrate that pulmonary eosinophilia 1) is a by-product of memory CD4+ T cell activation, 2) does not necessarily correlate with mucus production, and, most importantly, 3) is not required for the RSV G-induced illness in mice. These findings have important implications for the evaluation of candidate RSV vaccines.
