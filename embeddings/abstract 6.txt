usceptibilities to ultraviolet radiation (UV) of wavelength 280-320 nm (UVB) for 50% suppression of systemic contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses. Prevalence of histamine-staining dermal mast cells in different strains of mice (C57BL/ 6J, DBA/2, BALB/c) correlated directly with their susceptibility to UVB-induced systemic immunosuppression. BALB/c mice carrying Uvs1, a major locus for susceptibility to UV-induced immunosuppression, contained greater numbers of dermal mast cells than BALB/c mice of the same parental origin.

and Brugia malayi DNA by targeting the HhaI element in blood samples and mosquito vectors. The analytical sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. Our results indicated that the duplex ddPCR assay could differentiate and quantify W. bancrofti and B. malayi DNA from blood samples and mosquitoes. DNA from a single larva in 50 ml of a blood sample, or in one mosquito vector, could be detected. The analytical sensitivity and specificity for W. bancrofti are both 100 %. Corresponding values for B. malayi are 100 and 98.3 %, respectively.

Less-well studied has been the role that mother-to-offspring transmission may play in the facile transmission of CWD, and whether mother-to-offspring transmission before birth may contribute to the extensive spread of CWD. We thereby focused on a population of free-ranging white-tailed deer from West Virginia, USA, in which CWD has been detected.

Fetal tissues, ranging from 113 to 158 days of gestation, were harvested from the uteri of CWD+ dams in the asymptomatic phase of infection. Using serial protein misfolding amplification (sPMCA), we detected evidence of prion seeds in 7 of 14 fetuses (50%) from 7 of 9 pregnancies (78%), with the earliest detection at 113 gestational days.

Direct IFAT was performed following a diethyl ether concentration and results were expressed as oocysts per g of faeces (opg). Heine staining showed a sensitivity of 76.7% and a specificity of 90.7%. For faecal samples with ‡ 10,000opg, sensitivity increased to 90.0%. The sensitivity of the IC assay was lower (61.8%) but the specificity was 100%.

For faeces with ‡ 100,000opg, the sensitivity of the IC assay reached 81%, indicating some limitation for clinical cryptosporidiosis diagnosis. Additional scoring (1-5) of the Heine staining correlated with the corresponding direct IFAT results, particularly for ranges of 1000 to >1,000,000opg.

The effectiveness of this strategy has, however, been increasingly challenged by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance which now threatens the sustained utility of this approach. Humans and animals are constantly exposed to bacteria and have developed effective strategies to control pathogens involving innate and adaptive immune responses.

ered an efficient antiviral response permitting, among other actions, suppression of NSs filament formation and allowing establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.

rasiliensis re-infected lactating rats fed low-crude protein (CP) diets show an augmented degree of PPRI compared with their high CP-fed counterparts. However, such effects of CP scarcity have been confounded by metabolisable energy (ME) scarcity due to increased intake of the high-CP foods. Here, we independently assessed the effects of dietary CP and ME scarcity on the degree of PPRI. Second, parity rats were infected with N. brasiliensis larvae before mating.

Maternal inbreeding reduced breeding success, and this effect was mediated through lower hatching success and greater larval mortality. Furthermore, inbred mothers produced clutches where egg laying was less skewed towards the early part of laying than outbred females.

This reduction in the skew in egg laying is beneficial for larval survival, suggesting that inbred females adjusted their laying patterns facultatively, thereby partially compensating for the detrimental effects of maternal inbreeding on offspring. Finally, we found evidence of a nonlinear effect of offspring inbreeding coefficient on number of larvae dispersing.

Defects in macrophage phagocytosis of both bacteria and apoptotic cells contribute to the COPD phenotype. Small molecule inhibitors with anti-inflammatory activity against p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Rho kinase (ROCK) are being investigated as novel therapeutics in COPD.

Delivery of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) A(22) antigen to DC by rhuAdV5-FMDV-A(22) ex vivo resulted in significantly greater CD4(+) T cell proliferation than did delivery by rFPV-FMDV-A(22).

To unravel the EqHV evolutionary history within equid sister species, we analyzed 829 donkeys and 53 mules sampled in nine European, Asian, African, and American countries by molecular and serologic tools for EqHV infection.

A low RNA prevalence in spite of high seroprevalence suggests a predominance of acute infection, a possible difference from the mostly chronic hepacivirus infection pattern seen in horses and humans.

Our goal is to develop a TGK-specific inhibitor for coadministration with ascofuranone (AF), the most potent TAO inhibitor. Here, we report on the identification of novel compounds with inhibitory potency against TGK. Importantly, one of these compounds (compound 17) and its derivatives (17a and 17b) killed trypanosomes even in the absence of AF.

Seq technology can determine the sRNAs present in any symbiotic system, but there are very few bioinformatic tools available to interpret the results. We show that one of the biggest challenges comes from sequences that map equally well to the genomes of both interacting organisms. This arises due to the small size of the sRNAs compared to large genomes, and because a large portion of sequenced sRNAs come from genomic regions that encode highly conserved miRNAs, rRNAs or tRNAs.

Here, we present strategies to disentangle sRNA-Seq data from samples of communicating organisms, developed using diverse plant and animal species that are known to receive or exchange RNA with their symbionts. We show that sequence assembly, both de novo and genome-guided, can be used for these sRNA-Seq data, greatly reducing the ambiguity of mapping reads.

ream IgH constant region exons (e.g., C gamma, C epsilon, or C alpha), which affects switching from IgM to another IgH class (e.g., IgG, IgE, or IgA). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR by promoting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within switch (S) regions flanking the donor C mu (S mu) and a downstream acceptor C(H) (e.g., S gamma, S epsilon, S alpha) that are then joined to complete CSR. DSBs generated in S mu frequently are joined within S mu to form internal switch region deletions (ISD).

AID-induced ISD and mutations have been considered rare in downstream S regions, suggesting that AID targeting to these S regions requires its prior recruitment to S mu. We have now assayed for CSR and ISD in B cells lacking S mu (S mu(-/-) B cells).

targeting to these S regions requires its prior recruitment to S mu. We have now assayed for CSR and ISD in B cells lacking S mu (S mu(-/-) B cells). In S mu(-/-) B cells activated for CSR to IgG1 and IgE, CSR to IgG1 was greatly reduced; but, surprisingly, CSR to IgE occurred at nearly normal levels. Moreover, normal B cells had substantial S gamma1 ISD and increased mutations in and near S gamma1, and levels of both were greatly increased in S mu(-/-) B cells.

In infections with the longer lived Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the proportion of CD8alpha(int) DCs in the MLNC falls to below 10% of total DC numbers by 35 days post-infection.

These changes suggest the possibility that helminth parasites modulate gastrointestinal immunity both by inhibiting migration of CD8alpha(int) DCs to the draining lymph nodes, and modifying DC responsiveness in a manner which favours a Th2 outcome.

such a particle moves ballistically at short times, but eventually changes its orientation, and displays random-walk behaviour in the long-time limit. Theory predicts that if the velocity of non-interacting swimmers varies spatially in 1D, v(x), then their density r(x) satisfies r(x) = r(0)v(0)/v(x), where x = 0 is an arbitrary reference point. Such a dependence of steady-state r(x) on the particle dynamics, which was the qualitative basis of recent work demonstrating how to 'paint' with bacteria, is forbidden in thermal equilibrium.

However, the thymus phenotype is likely to be secondary to defects in pharyngeal pouch formation. Furthermore, the absence of Tbx1 expression in the thymus-fated domain of the wild-type 3rd pp suggested that Tbx1 is instead a negative regulator of thymus organogenesis.

To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel mouse strain in which expression of a conditional Tbx1 allele was ectopically activated in the thymus-fated domain of the 3rd pp. Ectopic Tbx1 expression severely repressed expression of Foxn1, a transcription factor that marks the thymus-fated domain and is required for differentiation and proliferation of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) progenitors.

Since chemokines can mediate the attraction of leucocytes towards the lymphatics, in vitro chemotaxis assays were used to determine whether chemokines might also act as chemoattractants for trypanosomes. Although microarray data suggested that the chemokines CCL8, CCL19, CCL21, CCL27 and CXCL12 were highly expressed in mouse skin, they did not stimulate the chemotaxis of T brucei.

Efficacy and safety of praziquantel in preschool-aged children in an area co-endemic for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. 2012 Authors: Jean T Coulibaly, Yve K N'gbesso, Stefanie Knopp, Jennifer Keiser, Eliézer K N'Goran, Jürg Utzinger Abstract: In sub-Saharan Africa the recommended strategy to control schistosomiasis is preventive chemotherapy. Emphasis is placed on school-aged children, but in high endemicity areas, preschool-aged children are also at risk, and hence might need treatment with praziquantel.

In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study, three different daily doses of TIP are administered either as continuous or cyclical regimens. The study protocol comprises 7-28 days of screening, 112 days of double-blind treatment and 56 days of follow-up. The plan was to enrol 180 patients (aged ‡18 years) with BE, documented Pa infection and a history of exacerbations.

Anti-human IgA (anti-IgA) was employed as an IgA receptor and was covalently immobilized on the IDE surface through a self-assembled monolayer, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy. EIS measurements revealed that the specific adsorption of IgA onto the immobilized anti-IgA gave rise to a clear increase in the value of interfacial charge transfer resistance (R(ct)).

This has been led to the widespread emergence of resistance in a number of small ruminant parasite species, especially Haemonchus contortus.

Hence it is very important to understand how resistance-conferring mutations emerge and spread in both parasites in buffalo and cattle hosts in order to develop approaches for the recognition of the problem at an early stage of its development.

These diseases can occur spontaneously, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, or be acquired or inherited. Prions are primarily formed of macromolecular assemblies of the disease-associated prion protein PrP(Sc), a misfolded isoform of the host-encoded prion protein PrP(C). Within defined host-species, prions can exist as conformational variants or strains.

In the case of two whole cells with separately expressed enzyme, the enzymatic activities of LAA and NAAAR could be balanced by changing the loading of individual cells. When the activities of two enzymes were fixed at 3600 U/L, 99.9% yield of l-HPA could be reached in 1 h, with a productivity of 10 mmol l-HPA/L h.

As of 2005, 107 patients had an ESKD diagnosis, 69 of whom (64%) were considered suitable for kidney transplantation (KT) and 34 (32%) had received a KT. Survival was similar for KT recipients and those awaiting KT (85% and 89% at 5 years, respectively; P = 0.53). Our results endorse the use of KT to manage ESKD in HIV-positive patients.

Acceleration of reductions in deaths due to pneumonia and diarrhoea, which together account for about 2 million child deaths every year, is essential if the target is to be met. Scaling up of existing interventions against the two diseases to 80% and immunisation to 90% would eliminate more than two-thirds of deaths from these two diseases at a cost of US$6·715 billion by 2025.

Modelling in this report shows that if all countries could attain the rates of decline of the regional leaders, then cause-specific death rates of fewer than three deaths per 1000 livebirths from pneumonia and less than one death per 1000 livebirths from diarrhoea could be achieved by 2025. These rates are those at which preventable deaths have been avoided.

-regulated HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) degradation and SREBP-2 cleavage are two major feedback regulatory mechanisms governing cholesterol biosynthesis. Reportedly, lanosterol selectively stimulates HMGCR degradation, and cholesterol is a specific regulator of SREBP-2 cleavage. However, it is unclear whether other endogenously generated sterols regulate these events. Here, we investigated the sterol intermediates from the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic engineering approach.

Here, we investigated the abilities of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), nanoparticles released by EHEC O157 during growth, to induce production of proinflammatory cytokines in human intestinal epithelial cells.

In this review, we define two key cellular players (macrophages and eosinophils) and their associated molecular players involved in Th2 granuloma function. To date, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, which is in part due to a lack of conclusive studies.

This papers present the results of an epidemiological study examining patterns of AMR in Escherichia coli isolates circulating in sympatric human (n = 321) and livestock (n = 633) samples from 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya. E. coli isolates were tested for susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial drugs representing nine antibiotic classes.

m 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya. E. coli isolates were tested for susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial drugs representing nine antibiotic classes. High rates of AMR were detected, with 47.6% and 21.1% of isolates displaying resistance to three or more and five or more antibiotic classes, respectively. Human isolates showed higher levels of resistance to sulfonamides, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and penicillins compared with livestock (P<0.01), while poultry isolates were more resistant to tetracyclines (P = 0.01) compared with humans.

The most common co-resistant phenotype observed was to tetracyclines, streptomycin and trimethoprim (30.5%). At the household level, AMR carriage in humans was associated with human density (P<0.01) and the presence of livestock manure (P = 0.03), but keeping livestock had no influence on human AMR carriage (P>0.05).

Here, we show that, as a prerequisite for IL-33-induced IL-13 secretion, Th2 cells required the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of its ligand, amphiregulin, for the formation of a signaling complex between T1/ST2 (the IL-33R) and EGFR.

This shared signaling complex allowed IL-33 to induce the EGFR-mediated activation of the MAP-kinase signaling pathway and consequently the expression of IL-13. Lack of EGFR expression on T cells abrogated IL-13 expression in infected tissues and impaired host resistance.

(PTLD) refers to a collection of clinically and pathologically diverse tumours associated with iatrogenic immunosuppression following transplantation. In most cases, tumourigenesis results from a deficit in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity that leads to uncontrolled EBV-driven outgrowth of latently infected B-lymphocytes. Conventional treatment for PTLD typically involves a reduction in immunosuppression, but this approach is frequently unsuccessful and mortality remains high.

An alternative, adoptive immunotherapy, involving the administration of EBV-specific CTLs cultured in vitro has been developed with the aim of selectively reconstituting EBV-directed immunity and effecting targeted tumour destruction. This approach has been the subject of several clinical studies, and these provide encouraging evidence of its clinical efficacy.

Invasion requires multiple interactions between merozoite ligands and erythrocyte receptors. P. falciparum reticulocyte binding homolog 5 (PfRh5) forms a complex with the PfRh5-interacting protein (PfRipr) and Cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) and binds erythrocytes via the host receptor basigin. However, the specific role that PfRipr and CyRPA play during invasion is unclear. Using P.

Using P. falciparum lines conditionally expressing PfRipr and CyRPA, we show that loss of PfRipr or CyRPA function blocks growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that PfRipr, CyRPA, and PfRh5 colocalize at the junction between merozoites and erythrocytes during invasion.

FRI upregulates the expression of FLC, a central floral repressor, to levels that inhibit flowering, resulting in the winter-annual habit. Here, we show that FRI promotes histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in FLC to upregulate its expression.

We identified an Arabidopsis homolog of the human WDR5, namely, WDR5a, which is a conserved core component of the human H3K4 methyltransferase complexes called COMPASS-like. We found that recombinant WDR5a binds H3K4-methylated peptides and that WDR5a also directly interacts with an H3K4 methyltransferase, ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX1.

2011 Jan 14 Authors: Andreas Holtel, Marita Troye-Blomberg, Inmaculada Penas-Jimenez Abstract: While malaria research has traditionally been strong in Europe, targeted and sustained support for cooperative malaria research at EU level, namely through the EU's 6th and 7th Framework Programmes for research and technological development, FP6 (2002-2006) and FP7 (2007-2013), has boosted both impact and visibility of European malaria research.

Most of the European malaria research community is now organized under a number of comprehensive and complementary research networks and projects, assembled around four key areas: (1) fundamental research on the malaria parasite and the disease, (2) development of new malaria drugs, (3) research and development of a malaria vaccine, and (4) research to control the malaria-transmitting mosquito vector.

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) remains the most life-threatening acute condition in modern gynaecology. It remains difficult to diagnose early and accurately. Women often present at emergency departments in early pregnancy with a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL) and diagnosis/exclusion of EP is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent studies suggest that serum levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease protein-12 (ADAM-12) can be used differentiate EP from viable intrauterine pregnancy (VIUP).

The toxicity endpoints including cytological and biochemical data in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were evaluated at 24 h after instillation. To evaluate the dose metric, each toxicity endpoint was plotted against the instilled dose (mass or surface area) or the equivalent dose (mass or surface area) that was weighted by the ratio of specific dose-generated responses between metal chlorides.

Xiang-Jin Meng Abstract: Genotypes 3 and 4 hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains within the species Orthohepevirus A in the family Hepeviridae are zoonotic. Recently, a genotype 4 HEV was reportedly detected in fecal samples of cows, although independent confirmation is lacking. In this study, we first tested serum samples from 983 cows in different regions in the United States for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HEV and found that 20.4% of cows were seropositive. The highest seroprevalence rate (68.4%) was from a herd in Georgia.

ve study was conducted in a known seropositive dairy herd by monitoring 10 newborn calves from birth to 6 months of age for evidence of HEV infection. At least 3 of the 10 calves seroconverted to IgG anti-HEV, and importantly the antibodies presented neutralized genotype 3 human HEV, thus, indicating the specificity of IgG anti-HEV in the cattle. However, our extensive attempts to identify HEV-related sequences in cattle using broad-spectrum reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and MiSeq deep-sequencing technology failed.

Evolution and Virulence of Influenza A Virus Protein PB1-F2. 2017 Dec 29 Authors: Ram P Kamal, Irina V Alymova, Ian A York Abstract: PB1-F2 is an accessory protein of most human, avian, swine, equine, and canine influenza A viruses (IAVs). Although it is dispensable for virus replication and growth, it plays significant roles in pathogenesis by interfering with the host innate immune response, inducing death in immune and epithelial cells, altering inflammatory responses, and promoting secondary bacterial pneumonia.

This can at least partially be explained by the presence of multiple PB1-F2 sequence variants, including premature stop codons that lead to the expression of truncated PB1-F2 proteins of different lengths and specific virulence-associated residues that enhance susceptibility to bacterial superinfection.

Cross-species transmission of PKV might be linked to interspecies conserved amino acids at 13-17 and 25-40 residue motifs of Kobuvirus VP1 proteins. Phylogeographic analysis showed that Spain was the most likely location of PKV origin, which then spread to pig-rearing countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Although there are challenges to inferring the existence of a virus from a `virus-like sequence', in the absence of an isolate the analysis of nucleic acid (including small RNAs) and sequence data can provide considerable confidence. As a consequence, this period of molecular natural history is helping to reshape our views of deep virus evolution.

terica serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum (SG) causes fowl typhoid (FT), a septicaemic disease which can result in high mortality in poultry flocks. The absence of flagella in SG is thought to favour systemic invasion, since bacterial recognition via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-5 does not take place during the early stages of FT. In the present study, chicks susceptible to FT were inoculated with a wild type SG (SG) or its flagellated motile derivative (SG Fla(+)).

r J, PTPRJ, is a tumor suppressor gene that has been implicated in a range of cancers, including breast cancer, yet little is known about its role in normal breast physiology or in mammary gland tumorigenesis. In this paper we show that PTPRJ mRNA is expressed in normal breast tissue and reduced in corresponding tumors. Meta-analysis revealed that the gene encoding PTPRJ is frequently lost in breast tumors and that low expression of the transcript associated with poorer overall survival at 20 years.

rapeutic applications. Recently, we reported a new single amino acid chelate (SAAC) capable of forming stable complexes with Tc(CO)3 or Re(CO)3 cores. We describe here the application of SAAC analogues for the development of a series of novel radiolabeled biotin derivatives capable of forming robust complexes with both Tc and Re. Compounds were prepared through varying modification of the free carboxylic acid group of biotin.

ble of forming robust complexes with both Tc and Re. Compounds were prepared through varying modification of the free carboxylic acid group of biotin. Each 99mTc complex of SAAC-biotin was studied for their ability to bind avidin, susceptibility to biotinidase, and specificity for avidin in an in vivo avidin-containing tumor model. The radiochemical stability of the 99mTc(CO)3 complexes was also investigated by challenging each 99mTc-complex with large molar excesses of cysteine and histidine at elevated temperature.

TcL6 and TcL9 were resistant to biotinidase cleavage, while TcL12a, which contains a lysine linkage, was rapidly cleaved. The highest uptake in an in vivo avidin tumor model was exhibited by TcL6, followed by TcL9 and TcL12a, respectively. This is likely the result of both intact binding to avidin and resistance to circulating biotinidase.

hways underpin diverse mechanisms of gene regulation and genome defense across all three kingdoms of life and are integral to virus-host interactions. In plants, fungi and many animals, an ancestral RNAi pathway exists as a host defense mechanism whereby viral double-stranded RNA is processed to small RNAs that enable recognition and degradation of the virus. While this antiviral RNAi pathway is not generally thought to be present in mammals, other RNAi mechanisms can influence infection through both viraland host-derived small RNAs.

anthelmintic administration to all horses based on the strongyle egg reappearance periods of each drug, usually defined around the time of licensing. Interval treatment programmes have resulted in substantial reductions in large strongyle disease, but have made major contributions to the development of anthelmintic resistance, particularly in cyathostomins. Cyathostomin resistance to 2 of the 3 available anthelmintic classes is widespread, and resistance to both classes in single populations is not uncommon.

Feline Aging: Promoting Physiologic and Emotional Well-Being. 2020 Jul Authors: Amy Miele, Lorena Sordo, Danielle A Gunn-Moore Abstract: Caring for an increasingly aging population of pet cats presents challenges. The interplay between emotional and physical health is an important consideration; their ability to cope with stress is reduced. Optimizing the environment can improve quality of life at home and within the clinic, as does early diagnosis and treatment of medical or behavioral problems.

ng the environment can improve quality of life at home and within the clinic, as does early diagnosis and treatment of medical or behavioral problems. This may be complicated by multiple, often interacting diseases, and the overlap of clinical signs, including behavioral change. Client education evenings and elderly cat clinics play a crucial role in making owners aware of normal aging changes. Differential diagnoses behind behavioral changes such are considered.

Combining fluorescence in situ hybridisation with super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, we show that chromatin around key differentiation gene loci Pax6 and Irx3 undergoes both decompaction and displacement towards the nuclear centre coincident with transcriptional onset.

differentiation gene loci Pax6 and Irx3 undergoes both decompaction and displacement towards the nuclear centre coincident with transcriptional onset. Conversely, down-regulation of Fgf8 as neural differentiation commences correlates with a more peripheral nuclear position of this locus. During normal neural differentiation, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is repressed by retinoic acid, and this vitamin A derivative is further required for transcription of neural genes.

ast growth factor (FGF) signalling is repressed by retinoic acid, and this vitamin A derivative is further required for transcription of neural genes. We show here that exposure to retinoic acid or inhibition of FGF signalling promotes precocious decompaction and central nuclear positioning of differentiation gene loci. Using the Raldh2 mutant as a model for retinoid deficiency, we further find that such changes in higher order chromatin organisation are dependent on retinoid signalling.

In this retinoid deficient condition, FGF signalling persists ectopically in the elongating body, and importantly, we find that inhibiting FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling in Raldh2-/- embryos does not rescue differentiation gene transcription, but does elicit both chromatin decompaction and nuclear position change.

We hypothesized that fibroblasts undergo a spectrum of phenotype states over the course of myocardial infarction (MI) from early onset to scar formation. Fibroblasts were isolated from the infarct region of C57BL/6J male mice (3-6 months old, n = 60) at days 0 (no MI control) and 1, 3, or 7 after MI. Whole transcriptome analysis was performed by RNA-sequencing.

Of the genes sequenced, 3371 were differentially expressed after MI. Enrichment analysis revealed that MI day 1 fibroblasts displayed pro-inflammatory, leukocyte-recruiting, pro-survival, and anti-migratory phenotype through Tnfrsf9 and CD137 signaling.

adian clocks being such a widespread phenomenon, demonstrating the fitness benefits of temporal coordination is challenging and such studies are rare. Here, we tested the consequences--for parasites--of being temporally mismatched to host circadian rhythms using the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. The cyclical nature of malaria infections is well known, as the cell cycles across parasite species last a multiple of approximately 24 h, but the evolutionary explanations for periodicity are poorly understood.

We demonstrate that perturbation of parasite rhythms results in a twofold cost to the production of replicating and transmission stages. Thus, synchronization with host rhythms influences in-host survival and between-host transmission potential, revealing a role for circadian rhythms in the evolution of host-parasite interactions.

To study the PDZ binding region in more detail, we prepared a peptide corresponding to the last 24 residues of Jagged-1, J1C24, and different phosphorylated variants of it. J1C24 displays a marked helical propensity and undergoes a coil-helix transition in the presence of negatively charged, but not zwitterionic, lysophospholipid micelles.

The pathogenesis of bovine neosporosis, particularly during the second term of gestation when most abortions occur in naturally infected dams, is poorly understood.

All experimental heifers were febrile between 3 and 5 days post infection (dpi).

Folding of tetrameric p53: oligomerization and tumorigenic mutations induce misfolding and loss of function. 2010 Jan 29 Authors: David J Lubin, James S Butler, Stewart N Loh Abstract: The physiologically active form of p53 consists of a tetramer of four identical 393-amino-acid subunits associated via their tetramerization domains (TDs; residues 325-355). One in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 (residues 94-312).

erization domains (TDs; residues 325-355). One in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 (residues 94-312). Most existing studies on the effects of these mutations on p53 structure and function have been carried out on the isolated DBD fragment, which is monomeric. Recent structural evidence, however, suggests that DBDs may interact with each other in full-length tetrameric forms of p53. Here, we investigate the effects of tumorigenic DBD mutations on the folding of p53 in its tetrameric form.

er in full-length tetrameric forms of p53. Here, we investigate the effects of tumorigenic DBD mutations on the folding of p53 in its tetrameric form. We employ the construct consisting of DBD and TD (amino acids 94-360). We characterize the stability and conformational state of the tumorigenic DBD mutants R248Q, R249S, and R282Q using equilibrium denaturation and functional assays. Destabilizing mutations cause DBD to misfold when it is part of the p53 tetramer, but not when it is monomeric.

um denaturation and functional assays. Destabilizing mutations cause DBD to misfold when it is part of the p53 tetramer, but not when it is monomeric. This conformation is populated under moderately destabilizing conditions (10 degrees C in 2 M urea, and at physiological temperature in the absence of denaturant). Under those same conditions, it is not present in the isolated DBD fragment or in the presence of the TD mutation L344P, which abolishes tetramerization.

er those same conditions, it is not present in the isolated DBD fragment or in the presence of the TD mutation L344P, which abolishes tetramerization. Misfolding appears to involve intramolecular DBD-DBD association within a single tetrameric molecule. This association is promoted by destabilization of DBD (caused by mutation or elevated temperature) and by the high local DBD concentration enforced by tetramerization of TD.
