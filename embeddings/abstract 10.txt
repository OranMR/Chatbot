tabolism by hydrolysis of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (eATP) into adenosine, exacerbates dextran-sulfate sodium-induced intestinal injury. This exacerbation of colitis is associated with reduction of colonic IL-22-producing ILC3s, which afford essential protection against intestinal inflammation, and is rescued by exogenous IL-22. Mechanistically, activation of ILC3s for IL-22 production is reciprocally mediated by eATP and adenosine.

The pyrethroid efficacy was contrasted with that of the organophosphate diazinon, since the louse populations examined were unlikely to have had prior exposure to this compound. The efficacy of diluted pure permethrin, the excipient, butyl dioxitol and the synergist piperonyl butoxide in the presence of the pyrethroids, were also considered.

At the concentrations recommended for animal application, neither 4% (w/v) permethrin, nor 0.1% (w/v) cypermethrin had any significant effect on the mortality of B. ocellatus and neither induced significantly more mortality than an acetone-only control. In contrast, 0.04% diazinon caused 70% mortality within 4h and 100% mortality after 24h exposure.

ress of infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) reprograms its metabolism to accommodate nutrient and energetic demands in a changing environment. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is an essential glycolytic enzyme in the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node that is a central switch point for carbon flux distribution. Here we show that the competitive binding of pentose monophosphate inhibitors or the activator glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to MtbPYK tightly regulates the metabolic flux.

The determination of a crystal structure of MtbPYK with bound ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), combined with biochemical analyses and molecular dynamic simulations, revealed that the allosteric inhibitor pentose monophosphate increases PYK structural dynamics, weakens the structural network communication, and impairs substrate binding.

steric inhibitor pentose monophosphate increases PYK structural dynamics, weakens the structural network communication, and impairs substrate binding. G6P, on the other hand, primes and activates the tetramer by decreasing protein flexibility and strengthening allosteric coupling. Therefore, we propose that MtbPYK uses these differences in conformational dynamics to upand down-regulate enzymic activity.

Here, we investigate whether environmental similarity among individuals can be partly explained by genetic variation for habitat selection, and how this link potentially blurs estimates for heritability in fitness-related traits. Using intensive GPS monitoring, we quantified home-range habitat composition for 293 roe deer inhabiting a heterogeneous landscape to assess environmental similarity.

We found substantial heritability for home-range habitat composition, with estimates ranging from 0.40 (proportion of meadows) to 0.85 (proportion of refuge habitat). Accounting for similarity in habitat composition between relatives decreased the heritability estimates for both behavioural and morphological traits (reduction ranging from 55% to 100% and from 22% to 41% respectively).

lysis and mathematical modeling to indicate that MeCP2 is a global transcriptional regulator whose binding to DNA creates "slow sites" in gene bodies. We hypothesize that waves of slowed-down RNA polymerase II formed behind these sites travel backward and indirectly affect initiation, reminiscent of defect-induced shockwaves in nonequilibrium physics transport models. This mechanism differs from conventional gene-regulation mechanisms, which often involve direct modulation of transcription initiation.

To exploit these developments, we developed a real-time one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid and sensitive detection of EV and HPeV in clinical specimens. Two commercially available RT-PCR kits were used (method I, Platinum one-step kit; method II, Express qPCR one-step kit) with primers and probes targeting the EV and HPeV 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTR).

Gain in accuracy was also observed for Minnesotans using the study-specific reference panel, although the increase was smaller than in Sardinians, especially for rare variants. Notably, a combined panel including both study-specific and 1000G reference panels improved imputation accuracy only in the Minnesota sample, and only at rare sites.

In cultured cells, RCMV expresses approximately 95% of the known viral ORFs with few differences between cell types. By contrast, in vivo viral-gene expression in tissues from rat heart allograft recipients is highly restricted.

Readapting to DCV Infection without Wolbachia: Frequency Changes of Drosophila Antiviral Alleles Can Replace Endosymbiont Protection. 2018 Jul 01 Authors: Vitor G Faria, Nelson E Martins, Christian Schlötterer, Élio Sucena Abstract: There is now ample evidence that endosymbionts can contribute to host adaptation to environmental challenges. However, how endosymbiont presence affects the adaptive trajectory and outcome of the host is yet largely unexplored.

ion to environmental challenges. However, how endosymbiont presence affects the adaptive trajectory and outcome of the host is yet largely unexplored. In Drosophila, Wolbachia confers protection to RNA virus infection, an effect that differs between Wolbachia strains and can be targeted by selection. Adaptation to RNA virus infections is mediated by both Wolbachia and the host, raising the question of whether adaptive genetic changes in the host vary with the presence/absence of the endosymbiont.

Here, we address this question using a polymorphic D. melanogaster population previously adapted to DCV infection for 35 generations in the presence of Wolbachia, from which we removed the endosymbiont and followed survival over the subsequent 20 generations of infection.

After an initial severe drop, survival frequencies upon DCV selection increased significantly, as seen before in the presence of Wolbachia.

Abstract: Antibodies from individuals living in areas where malaria is endemic are known to react with parasite-derived erythrocyte surface proteins. The major immunogenic and clonally variant surface antigen described to date is Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), which is encoded by members of the multicopy var gene family. We report here that rifin proteins (RIF proteins), belonging to the largest known family of variable infected erythrocyte surface-expressed proteins, are also naturally immunogenic.

ls were detected in the majority of the adult population tested, whereas the prevalence of such antibodies was much lower in malaria-exposed children. Despite the high degree of diversity between rif sequences and the high gene copy number, it appears that P. falciparum infections can induce antibodies that cross-react with several variant rifin molecules in many parasite isolates in a given community, and the immune response is most likely to be stable over time in a hyperendemic area.

Herein we have developed a library of coumarin hybrids by condensation of various heterocyclic quaternary salts to a 7-hydroxycoumarin scaffold. From our library we identified one benzothiazole-coumarin hybrid as a red-fluorescent compound with emission maxima around 620 nm and a strong fluorogenic response.

ancock, Marek Petrivalsky, David Wendehenne, Gary J Loake Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is perfectly suited for the role of a redox signalling molecule. A key route for NO bioactivity occurs via protein S-nitrosation, and involves the addition of a NO moiety to a protein cysteine (Cys) thiol (-SH) to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO). This process is thought to underpin a myriad of cellular processes in plants that are linked to development, environmental responses and immune function.

This study fills this gap by analysing published data where pre-challenge HI titres are available for individual ferrets, and post-challenge outcomes have been recorded. Ultimately, this work confirms that it is the absolute, rather than relative, HI titre that determines the extent of immunity and that there is a threshold HI titre beyond which ferrets are completely protected from infection.

pidemiological pattern that is prerequisite for the occurrence of dual infections, which can lead to recombination between co-infecting virus strains. Viral sequences were determined at loci 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (non structural proteins) in 49 E-6 strains recovered in a single geographical region in France from 1999 to 2007, during the epidemiological survey of enterovirus infections. They were compared with previously recorded sequences of E-30 strains to investigate their evolutionary histories and possible recombination patterns.

They were compared with previously recorded sequences of E-30 strains to investigate their evolutionary histories and possible recombination patterns. Phylogenetic analyses identified two distinct E-6 populations and different subpopulations. Assuming a relaxed molecular clock model and a Bayesian skyline demographic model in coalescent analyses with the BEAST program, the substitution rate in E-6 was estimated at 8.597×10(-3) and 6.252×10(-3) substitution/site/year for loci 1D and 3CD respectively.

o cross the plant cell wall. Many viruses encode a conserved set of three MPs, known as the triple gene block (TGB), typified by Potato virus X (PVX). In this paper, using live-cell imaging of viral RNA (vRNA) and virus-encoded proteins, we show that the TGB proteins have distinct functions during movement. TGB2 and TGB3 established endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranous caps at PD orifices. These caps harbored the PVX replicase and nonencapsidated vRNA and represented PD-anchored viral replication sites.

Understanding the biological determinants of protein glycome provides a basis for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Crucially, reversal of these histone modifications coupled with histone acetylation drives viral reactivation which can be blocked with specific histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi). In lytic infection, a role for HATi is less clear despite the well-established enhancement of viral replication observed with histone deacetylase inhibitors.

Nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2) is the most variable functional protein in the PRRSV genome and can generate NSP2N and NSP2TF variants due to programmed ribosomal frameshifts. These variants are broad and complex in function and play key roles in numerous aspects of viral protein maturation, viral particle assembly, regulation of immunity, autophagy, apoptosis, cell cycle and cell morphology.

Resistance to TGFb suppression, while disadvantageous in autoimmunity, helps Ptpn22 <sup>-/-</sup> T cells to be intrinsically superior at clearing established tumors that secrete TGFb.

uis Bont, Federico Martinón-Torres Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children. By the age of 1 year, 60%-70% of children have been infected by RSV. In addition, early-life RSV infection is associated with the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma in infancy and childhood. The need for precise epidemiologic data regarding RSV as a worldwide pathogen has been growing steadily as novel RSV therapeutics are reaching the final stages of development.

emiologic data regarding RSV as a worldwide pathogen has been growing steadily as novel RSV therapeutics are reaching the final stages of development. To optimize the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of RSV infection in a timely manner, knowledge about the differences in the timing of the RSV epidemics worldwide is needed. Previous analyses, based on literature reviews of individual reports obtained from medical databases, have failed to provide global country seasonality patterns.

The viral B5 and F13 protein components of this membrane, which are required for wrapping, normally colocalize in the trans-Golgi network. However, only B5 traffics through the secretory pathway, suggesting that F13 uses another route to the trans-Golgi network.

The retrograde route was demonstrated by finding that F13 was largely confined to early endosomes and failed to colocalize with B5 in the presence of Retro-2. Thus, vaccinia virus makes novel use of the retrograde transport system for formation of the viral wrapping membrane.

Using simulations based on our lab estimates of transmission rates, we show that the biparental mode of transmission allows the virus to invade and rapidly spread through populations at rates consistent with those measured in the field. Therefore, as predicted by our simulations, the virus has undergone an extremely rapid and recent increase in population size.

Tree Abstract: Enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EHEC) is a significant human pathogen that colonizes humans and its reservoir host, cattle. Colonization requires the expression of a type 3 secretion (T3S) system that injects a mixture of effector proteins into host cells to promote bacterial attachment and disease progression. The T3S system is tightly regulated by a complex network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators.

Using transposon mutagenesis, here we identified the <i>ybeZYX-Int</i> operon as being required for normal T3S levels. Deletion analyses localized the regulation to the endoribonuclease YbeY, previously linked to 16S rRNA maturation and small RNA (sRNA) function. Loss of <i>ybeY</i> in EHEC had pleiotropic effects on EHEC cells, including reduced motility and growth and cold sensitivity.

immunocompromised recipients of a bone marrow transplant. In a murine model, lungs were identified as a prominent site of CMV latency and recurrence. Pulmonary latency of murine CMV is characterized by high viral genome burden and a low incidence of variegated immediate-early (IE) gene expression, reflecting a sporadic activity of the major IE promoters (MIEPs) and enhancer. The enhancer-flanking promoters MIEP1/3 and MIEP2 are switched on and off during latency in a ratio of approximately 2:1.

In accordance with previous work of others, we show here that signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) activates IE1/3 transcription in vivo.

Notably, TNF-alpha promoted the splicing to IE3 transcripts, but transcription did not proceed to the M55/gB early gene. Moreover, the activated transcriptional state induced by TNF-alpha did not predispose latently infected mice to a higher incidence of virus recurrence after hematoablative treatment.

It has been demonstrated that these 5mC oxidation derivatives are in a dynamic state and have pivotal regulatory functions. Here, we comprehensively summarized the recent research progress in the understanding of the physiological functions of the TET proteins and their mechanisms of regulation of DNA methylation and transcription.

gress in the understanding of the physiological functions of the TET proteins and their mechanisms of regulation of DNA methylation and transcription. Among the three TET genes, TET1 and TET2 expression levels have frequently been shown to be low in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and received most attention. The modulation of TET1 also correlates with microRNAs in a post-transcriptional regulatory process. Additionally, recent studies revealed that global genomic 5hmC levels are down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines.

NO accumulation promotes SRG1 expression and subsequently SRG1 occupies a repeated canonical sequence within target promoters.

Sustained NO synthesis drives SRG1 S-nitrosylation predominantly at Cys87, relieving both SRG1 DNA binding and transcriptional repression activity. Accordingly, mutation of Cys87 compromises NO-mediated control of SRG1-dependent transcriptional suppression.

Currently NTDs are prevalent in 149 countries, seventeen of these neglected tropical parasitic diseases are classified as endemic.

This parasitosis is characterized by being initially asymptomatic, but it is able to evolve into more severe clinical forms, potentially causing death. Globally, more than 200 million people are infected with one of three Schistosome species, including an estimated 40 million women of reproductive age. In Brazil, about 12 million children require preventive chemotherapy with anthelmintic.

Currently, the main forms of treatment used for schistosomiasis are praziquantel (PZQ) and oxaminiquine (OXA). PZQ is the drug of choice because it presents as a high-spectrum anthelmintic, used in the treatment of all known species of schistosomiasis and some species of cestodes and trematodes. OXA, however, is not active against the three Schistosome species.

However, the phenoloxidase cascade also plays a significant role in insect immunity, leading to the additional hypothesis that the thermal environment indirectly shapes immune function via direct selection on cuticle color. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the cricket Allonemobius socius, where cuticle darkness and immune-related phenoloxidase activity increase with latitude.

Here, we describe a specific Argonaute protein (exWAGO) that is secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri, at multiple copies per EV. Phylogenetic and gene expression analyses demonstrate exWAGO orthologues are highly conserved and abundantly expressed in related parasites but highly diverged in free-living genus Caenorhabditis.

We show that the most abundant small RNAs released from the nematode parasite are not microRNAs as previously thought, but rather secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are produced by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases. The siRNAs that are released in EVs have distinct evolutionary properties compared to those resident in free-living or parasitic nematodes.

Whenever a faecal egg count (FEC) result exceeded 250 eggs per gram (EPG), the horse was treated with pyrantel, ivermectin or moxidectin. In 52 of 129 horses (40.3%), no strongyle eggs were ever detected over the course of 9 months. In 39 horses (30.2%), strongyle eggs were detected in at least 1 sample, but the egg count never exceeded 250 EPG.

The remaining 38 (29.5%) horses were treated at least once in response to a FEC that exceeded 250 EPG. As a result of this selective anthelmintic scheme, the total number of anthelmintic treatments was reduced to 54% of the number of treatments administered to the same horses in the previous year. Both the maximum and mean FEC dropped significantly after initiation of the study.

A statistically significant, negative correlation was demonstrated between the maximum and mean FEC of a horse and its age. Pasture hygiene appeared to reduce FECs, but the effect was not statistically significant.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by complement-mediated cell lysis due to deficiency of GPI-anchored complement regulators. Blockage of the lytic pathway by eculizumab is the only available therapy for PNH patients and shows remarkable benefits, but regularly yields PNH erythrocytes opsonized with fragments of complement protein C3, rendering such erythrocytes prone to extravascular hemolysis. This effect is associated with insufficient responsiveness seen in a subgroup of PNH patients.

urrent clinical practices that include fetal heart rate monitoring and fetal scalp blood sampling are shown to be either inadequate or time-consuming. Monitoring of lactate in blood is identified as a potential alternative for intrapartum fetal monitoring due to its ability to distinguish between different types of acidosis. A literature review from a medical and technical perspective is presented to identify the current advancements in the field of lactate sensors for this application.

To determine whether the Sertoli cells regulate other aspects of adult testis biology we have used a novel transgenic mouse model in which Amh-Cre induces expression of the receptor for Diphtheria toxin (iDTR) specifically within Sertoli cells. This causes controlled, cell-specific and acute ablation of the Sertoli cell population in the adult animal following Diphtheria toxin injection.

Results show that Sertoli cell ablation leads to rapid loss of all germ cell populations. In addition, adult Leydig cell numbers decline by 75% with the remaining cells concentrated around the rete and in the sub-capsular region. In the absence of Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cell activity is reduced but the cells retain an ability to exclude immune cells from the seminiferous tubules.

IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on the subject? Ectopic pregnancy (EP) can be associated with severe maternal morbidity with up to a third of women with EP being managed after the pregnancy has ruptured. To try and reduce severe maternal morbidity and improve management for these women it is vital to identify the important risk factors associated with severe maternal morbidity.

Gonadal sex differentiation is just one of the many manifestations of sexual phenotype. As in other birds, the chicken has a ZZ male: ZW female sex chromosome system, in which the male is the homogametic sex. Most evidence favours a Z chromosome dosage mechanism underling chicken sex determination, with little evidence of a role for the W chromosome.

Indeed, the W appears to harbour a small number of genes that are un-related to sexual development, but have been retained because they are dosage sensitive factors. As global Z dosage compensation is absent in birds, Z-linked genes may direct sexual development in different tissues (males having on average 1.5 to 2 times the expression level of females).

In the embryonic gonads, the Z-linked DMRT1 gene plays a key role in testis development. Beyond the gonads, other combinations of Z-linked genes may govern sexual development, together with a role for sex steroid hormones.

Whereas these studies have investigated the impact of sex on adaptation to stressful abiotic environments, the potential for biotic interactions to influence this advantage of sex has been largely ignored. Species rarely exist in isolation in natural conditions, so the impact of sex on adaptation to a stressful abiotic environment may be altered by the interactions between coexisting species.

nal-level gross losses due to reaction and expenditure during 2017. Data were collected from 112 herders across eight provinces that reported disease. Seventy of these herders had cases of FMD, while 42 did not have FMD in their animals but were within quarantine zones. Overall, 86/112 herders reported not drinking milk for a period of time and 38/112 reduced their meat consumption. Furthermore, 55 herders (49.1%) had to borrow money to buy food, medicines and/or pay bills or bank loans.

and 38/112 reduced their meat consumption. Furthermore, 55 herders (49.1%) had to borrow money to buy food, medicines and/or pay bills or bank loans. Among herders with FMD cases, the median attack rate was 31.7%, 3.8% and 0.59% in cattle, sheep and goats, respectively, with important differences across provinces. Herders with clinical cases before the winter had higher odds of reporting a reduction in their meat consumption. National-level gross losses due to FMD in 2017 were estimated using government data.

This method involves lentiviral red-green-blue (RGB) marking of cell populations, which enabled us to track individual cells and their clonal outgrowth during tumor initiation and growth in a xenograft model. We found that clonal expansion largely depends on the location of a clone, as small clones reside in the center and large clones mostly drive tumor growth at the border.

These dynamics are recapitulated in a computational model, which confirms that the clone position within a tumor rather than cell-intrinsic features, is crucial for clonal outgrowth.

We explore the performance of existing analysis tools given these biases and discuss approaches to limiting or handling biases in RAD-Seq data.

While these biases need to be taken seriously, we believe RAD loci affected by them can be excluded or processed with relative ease in most cases and that most RAD loci will be accurately genotyped by existing tools.

Speciation by sexual selection: 20 years of progress. 2021 Dec Authors: Tamra C Mendelson, Rebecca J Safran Abstract: Twenty years ago, a seminal paper summarized the role of sexual selection in speciation as the coordinated evolution of (male) courtship signals and (female) preferences leading to prezygotic (behavioral) isolation between divergent lineages. Here, we discuss areas of progress that inspire an updated perspective.

ences leading to prezygotic (behavioral) isolation between divergent lineages. Here, we discuss areas of progress that inspire an updated perspective. First, research has identified multiple mechanisms of sexual selection, in addition to female mate choice, that drive the origin and maintenance of species. Second, reviews and empirical data now conclude that sexual selection alone will rarely lead to reproductive isolation without ecological divergence, and we discuss the assumptions and possible exceptions underlying that conclusion.

To determine the influence of species-specific amino-acid substitutions recognized by monoclonal antibodies, and to investigate the immunohistochemical reactivity of the latter, analyses were carried out on brain sections of cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, sheep with scrapie, mice infected with scrapie, and human beings with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or Gerstmann-Sträussler-Sheinker disease (GSS).

Some monoclonal antibodies against mouse recombinant PrP gave strong signals with bovine, ovine and human PrP(Sc), in addition to murine PrP(Sc), even though the amino-acid sequences determined by the antibody epitope are not fully identical with the amino-acid sequences proper to the species.

In the region corresponding to positions 134-159 of murine PrP, immunohistochemical reactivity or species-specificity recognized by the antibodies may be determined by one amino acid corresponding to position 144 of murine PrP.

and environmental interactions. The emerging evidence implies that specificity in redox signalling is achieved by a multilayered molecular framework. This encompasses the production of redox cues in the locale of the given protein target and protein tertiary structures that convey the appropriate local chemical environment to support redox-based, post-translational modifications (PTMs). Nascent nitrosylases have also recently emerged that mediate the formation of redox-based PTMs.

Nascent nitrosylases have also recently emerged that mediate the formation of redox-based PTMs. Reversal of these redox-based PTMs, rather than their formation, is also a major contributor of signalling specificity. In this context, the activities of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase and thioredoxin h5 (Trxh5) are a key feature.
