studies suggest that classical complement components facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cells and that failure to do so predisposes mice to lupus. Since IgM is a potent activator of the classical complement pathway, we examined IgM binding to dying cells. IgM, but not IgG, bound to apoptotic T cells through the Fab' portion of the antibody. Exposure of apoptotic cell membranes to phospholipase (PL) A2 increased, whereas PLD reduced, IgM binding and complement activation.

Absorption studies combined with direct plate binding assays, revealed that IgM antibodies failed to bind to phosphatidyl lipids, but did recognize lysophosphatidylcholine and the phosphorylcholine head group.

Since inhibition of iPLA2, but not cPLA2, attenuated IgM binding to apoptotic cells, these results strongly suggest that the endogenous calcium independent PLA(2), iPLA(2), is involved in the hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids and exposure of the epitope(s) recognized by IgM.

Indeed, the presence of FDCs could be used to reliably distinguish ILF maturity. Further analysis revealed that the area occupied by the FDCs within mature ILFs was substantial. The total area occupied by FDCs in all the mature ILFs in mice lacking PPs was equivalent to the total area occupied by FDCs in all the PPs and the few mature ILFs in immunocompetent mice.

the mature ILFs in mice lacking PPs was equivalent to the total area occupied by FDCs in all the PPs and the few mature ILFs in immunocompetent mice. Based on these data we reasoned that in the absence of PPs, mature ILFs are important inductive sites for intestinal immune responses. Indeed, in mice that lacked PPs, ILF maturation coincided with a restoration of faecal immunoglobulin A levels to values that were comparable to those found in immunocompetent mice.

Recently it was shown in endothelial cells that Jumonji domain containing protein 6 (JMJD6) hydroxylates U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 65-kDa subunit (U2AF65, a component of the splicesome). The hydroxylation by JMJD6 is oxygen dependent. Under hypoxia, JMJD6 is less able to hydroxylate U2AF65, and this unhydroxylated form of U2AF65 biases splicing of FLT-1 to sFLT-1.

Here, we discuss the rather limited body of experimental work that addresses how kin-selected social behaviours affect virulence.

that is, when individuals need to donate public goods, such as extracellular enzymes), virulence is predicted to increase with increasing relatedness. The limited studies testing this hypothesis are broadly consistent with this prediction. Finally, there is some empirical evidence supporting theory that suggests that spiteful behaviours are maximized at intermediate degrees of relatedness, which, in turn, leads to minimal virulence because of the reduced growth rate of the infecting population.

Kin selection, quorum sensing and virulence in pathogenic bacteria. 2012 Sep 07 Authors: Kendra P Rumbaugh, Urvish Trivedi, Chase Watters, Maxwell N Burton-Chellew, Stephen P Diggle, Stuart A West Abstract: Bacterial growth and virulence often depends upon the cooperative release of extracellular factors excreted in response to quorum sensing (QS). We carried out an in vivo selection experiment in mice to examine how QS evolves in response to variation in relatedness (strain diversity), and the consequences for virulence.

selection experiment in mice to examine how QS evolves in response to variation in relatedness (strain diversity), and the consequences for virulence. We started our experiment with two bacterial strains: a wild-type that both produces and responds to QS signal molecules, and a lasR (signal-blind) mutant that does not release extracellular factors in response to signal. We found that: (i) QS leads to greater growth within hosts; (ii) high relatedness favours the QS wild-type; and (iii) low relatedness favours the lasR mutant.

that: (i) QS leads to greater growth within hosts; (ii) high relatedness favours the QS wild-type; and (iii) low relatedness favours the lasR mutant. Relatedness matters in our experiment because, at relatively low relatedness, the lasR mutant is able to exploit the extracellular factors produced by the cells that respond to QS, and hence increase in frequency.

A standard approach to analyze glycosylation of IgGs involves the release of the N-glycans by the enzyme peptide N-glycosidase F, which cleaves the linkage between the asparagine residue and innermost N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of all N-glycans except those containing a 3-linked fucose attached to the reducing terminal GlcNAc residue.

The faecal egg count reduction was 76.7% (95% CI: 55.1-82.2%) following treatment with 2.5 mg/kg monepantel. Predominantly Trichostrongylus vitrinus along with small proportions of Oesophagostomum venulosum and Trichostrongylus vitrinus were identified by deep amplicon sequencing of pools of larvae recovered from pre and post monepantel treatment coprocultures and on postmortem examinations.

The undifferentiated FECRT showed resistance to monepantel, but not to levamisole, ivermectin, or moxidectin. Examination of farm anthelmintic treatment and animal movement records suggested that treatments before movement onto silage aftermaths, putatively with low numbers of susceptible nematodes in refugia, may have placed a high selection pressure on monepantel resistance.

Effective control of parasitic gastroenteritis using anthelmintic drugs is a prerequisite for sustainable sheep production. This case reiterates the need for care when combining anthelmintic treatments with movements to safe grazing, and the value of monitoring of anthelmintic efficacy as part of iterative planned animal health management.

ted cells secrete a broad range of interferons (IFN) which confer resistance to yet uninfected cells by triggering the synthesis of antiviral factors. The relative contributions of the various IFN subtypes to innate immunity against virus infections remain elusive. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and other type I IFN molecules signal through a common, universally expressed cell surface receptor, whereas type III IFN (IFN-lambda) uses a distinct cell-type-specific receptor complex for signaling.

Using mice lacking functional receptors for type I IFN, type III IFN, or both, we found that IFN-lambda plays an important role in the defense against several human pathogens that infect the respiratory tract, such as influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.

In contrast, Lassa fever virus, which infects via the respiratory tract but primarily replicates in the liver, was not influenced by the IFN-lambda receptor defect.

Based on evidence from other gastrointestinal nematodes, resistance in N. battus is likely to be conferred by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the b-tubulin isotype 1 locus at codons 167, 198 and 200. Pyrosequencing and deep amplicon sequencing assays were designed to identify the F167Y (TTC to TAC), E198A (GAA to GCA) and F200Y (TTC to TAC) SNPs.

A hallmark of this peculiar myeloid population is the expression of macrophage markers distinct from the markers found on osteoclast surface. In bone, osteomacs are in contact with osteoblasts, where they are involved in regulating bone homeostasis.

Indeed, bone marrow macrophages have been found to eliminate apoptotic cells, particularly apoptotic osteoblasts through a process named efferocytosis. This phagocytic process plays an essential role in bone tissue homeostasis and new bone formation. In addition, bone marrow macrophages can influence the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches.

They contribute to the regulation of the HSC progenitor cell maintenance, mobilization, and function. To do so, macrophages secrete cytokines in steady state or during stress conditions. These cytokines influence hematopoiesis either by a direct effect on HSCs or through the control of stromal cells that are essential for the HSC niches.

ese cytokines influence hematopoiesis either by a direct effect on HSCs or through the control of stromal cells that are essential for the HSC niches. Interestingly, the similarities between the niches for HSCs and the niche for metastatic tumor cells support the possibility that bone-resident macrophages could control the homing of tumor cells and their proliferation within the bone. In general, macrophage role during metastatic processes is well described; however, their direct involvement in bone metastasis is a rising research area.

Monitoring of complete blood counts, urinalysis or ciclosporin levels is not justified except with higher than recommended doses and/or long-term concurrent immunosuppressive drugs. Ciclosporin is not a contraindication for killed (including rabies) vaccines, but the licensed recommendation is that live vaccination is avoided during treatment.

Life-prolonging measures for a dead theory? 2014 Apr Authors: Ulrich R Ernst, Wouter De Haes, Dries Cardoen, Liliane Schoofs Abstract: In a recent review article, Selman and colleagues (Trends Ecol Evol 27:570-577, 2012) discuss the status quo of the oxidative stress theory of aging (OSTA) and how it links to life history evolution. They suggest that the OSTA should be tested in wild populations which might show effects masked in laboratory settings. We disagree with their propositions for several reasons.

We argue that there is increasing evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not causally linked with aging and that ROS do not play a straightforward role in shaping life history evolution. We propose that laboratory animals and semi-wild populations rather than wild animals are suited best to test any hypothesized effect of reactive oxygen species.

transform genetic associations into drug targets requires evidence that a particular gene, and its encoded protein, contribute causally to a disease. To achieve this, we employ a three-step proteome-by-phenome Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach. In step one, 154 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were identified and independently replicated. From these pQTLs, 64 replicated locally-acting variants were used as instrumental variables for proteome-by-phenome MR across 846 traits (step two).

Abstract: NLRP3 is associated with multiple risks in graft-versus-host disease, though unifying principles for these findings remain largely unknown. To explore the effects and mechanisms of the absence of NLRP3 function on hepatic graft-versus-host-disease, we established an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation mice model by infusing bone marrow mononuclear cells and spleno-T cells of the BALB/c mouse into either NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> ) or wild-type C57BL/6 mice.

sing bone marrow mononuclear cells and spleno-T cells of the BALB/c mouse into either NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> ) or wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Elevated inflammatory cell infiltration, liver fibrosis, and secretions of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), together with weight loss, were observed in C57BL/6 recipients after transplantation. However, moderate injury pathology was detected in the liver of NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> recipients at day 14, which gradually improved over time.

Moreover, compared with C57BL/6 recipients, the expression of both TNF-a and IL-1b were decreased 3-fold and 4.7-fold, respectively, at day 21 in NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> recipients.

In contrast, the concentration of IL-1b in C57BL/6 recipients gradually increased from day 7 to day 28.

Combining in vivo and in vitro approaches utilizing rodent and human malaria parasites, we reveal that: (i) 57% of Plasmodium chabaudi genes exhibit daily rhythms in transcription; (ii) 58% of these genes lose transcriptional rhythmicity when the IDC is out-of-synchrony with host rhythms; (iii) 6% of Plasmodium falciparum genes show 24 h rhythms in expression under free-running conditions; (iv) Serpentine receptor 10 (SR10) has a 24 h transcriptional rhythm and disrupting it in rodent malaria parasites shortens the IDC by 2-3 h; (v) Multiple

In this review, we consider the role of malaria-induced immunoregulatory responses in tipping the balance from tissue homeostasis during malaria infection to risk of invasive NTS. Also, neutrophils are crucial in the clearance of NTS but their ability to mount an oxidative burst and kill intracellular Salmonella is severely compromised during, and for some time after, an acute malaria infection.

Without exemptions, a shorter movement standstill is almost as effective as a longer standstill period, indicating that a simpler biosecurity system would offer minimal additional risk for FMD.

Marek's disease vaccines: a solution for today but a worry for tomorrow? 2008 Jul 18 Authors: Isabel M Gimeno Abstract: Marek's disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens that, in the absence of control measures, is capable of causing devastating losses in commercial poultry flocks. MD has been successfully controlled by vaccination since 1968. However, vaccine efficacy has decreased concomitantly with the increase in virulence of Marek's disease virus (MDV).

The constant evolution of MDV has forced the development of new vaccines or vaccine strategies that control the more virulent emergent strains. However, this race between the introduction of new vaccines and the evolution of MDV represents a major threat for the poultry industry.

In addition to vaccination, other factors might have contributed to the evolution of MDV (intensive methods of chicken production, early exposure of the chickens to MDV and administration of vaccines at very low doses). From all the possible factors influencing MDV evolution, the effect of vaccination has received the greatest attention.

MD vaccines protect with great efficacy against the development of the disease but they do not prevent infection or transmission. Sterilizing immunity could be a solution to stop the evolution of the virus but it has been proven to be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to obtain with MDV or with other herpesviruses.

parvovirus type 1 (PPV1) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are small single-stranded DNA viruses with high prevalence in the global pig population. The aim of this study was to compare and contrast PCV2 and PPV1 infections in high-health status pigs and to describe PCV2 long-term infection dynamics. Six caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived pigs were randomly divided into two groups and were experimentally infected with PCV2 or PPV1 at 5 weeks of age. All pigs had detectable viremia by day (D) 3 post-infection.

Pigs infected with PPV1 had a detectable INF-a response by D3 followed by a high IFN-g response by D6. The PPV1 pigs developed antibodies against PPV1 by D6 resulting in decreasing virus titers until PPV1 DNA became undetectable from D28 until D42. In contrast, PCV2-infected pigs had no detectable INF-a or IFN-g response after PCV2 infection.

For example, both indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects drive the observational relationship between lower birth weight and higher later blood pressure: maternal blood pressure-raising alleles reduce offspring birth weight, but only direct fetal effects of these alleles, once inherited, increase later offspring blood pressure.

Such a change in the rate of resource acquisition has broad implications for population growth or dynamics and for interactions with, for instance, predators and parasites. This maternal effect can also explain the previously puzzling situation that the offspring of well-fed mothers, despite being smaller, grow and reproduce better than the offspring of food-starved mothers.

Women often present in early pregnancy with a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL) and the diagnosis and exclusion of EP is difficult due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. A serum biomarker able to clearly distinguish between EP and other pregnancy outcomes would greatly assist clinicians in diagnosing and safely managing PULs.

However, these survey tools identify children with reported symptoms of pneumonia, and because the prevalence of pneumonia over a two-week period in community settings is low, the majority of these children do not have true pneumonia and so do not provide an accurate denominator of pneumonia cases for monitoring antibiotic treatment rates.

ongylid nematode parasites of livestock inhabit two very different niches during their life-cycle; within the host and free-living in the environment. UV radiation plays a significant role in the survival of free-living, pre-parasitic nematode larvae, with different species exhibiting differing levels of sensitivity. In many eukaryotes, melanisation is a key protective mechanism against UV damage, however there is little information about this process in parasitic nematodes.

karyotes, melanisation is a key protective mechanism against UV damage, however there is little information about this process in parasitic nematodes. Caenorhabditis elegans cat-4 mutants, which are deficient in the enzyme guanosine triphosphate-cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH), have both depleted levels of melanin in their cuticles and an increased sensitivity to anthelmintic drugs. Some parasitic nematodes have very high levels of GTP-CH transcript in their pre-parasitic stages, suggesting an important role for this biopterin synthetic enzyme.

nematodes have very high levels of GTP-CH transcript in their pre-parasitic stages, suggesting an important role for this biopterin synthetic enzyme. Here, we show that the Tci-cat-4 gene, which encodes GTP-CH in Teladorsagia circumcincta, has a role in melanisation and is also capable of rescuing C. elegans cat-4 mutants. In addition, following exposure of T. circumcincta L3s to sunlight, there is a 32% increase in GTP-CH enzyme activity (P=0.019), and a 21% increase in levels of melanin (P=0.031) compared with unexposed larvae.

However, contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify canonical (i.e. Drosophilaor nematode-like) viRNAs in any of the animals, despite the widespread presence of abundant micro-RNAs, and somatic transposon-derived piwi-interacting RNAs. We did identify a distinctive group of small RNAs derived from RNA viruses in the mollusc.

However, unlike ecdysozoan viRNAs, these had a piRNA-like length distribution but lacked key signatures of piRNA biogenesis. We also identified primary piRNAs derived from putatively endogenous copies of DNA viruses in the cnidarian and the echinoderm, and an endogenous RNA virus in the mollusc.

The absence of canonical virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response. Alternatively, these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, with cryptic viRNAs not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals.

In a large study of African-American men and women (n = 14,419), we genotyped and analyzed 966,578 autosomal SNPs across the entire genome using a linear mixed model variance components approach implemented in the program GCTA (Yang et al Nat Genet 2010), and estimated an additive heritability of 44.7% (se: 3.7%) for this phenotype in a sample of evidently unrelated individuals.

While this estimated value is similar to that given by Yang et al in their analyses, we remain concerned about two related issues: (1) whether in the complete absence of hidden relatedness, variance components methods have adequate power to estimate heritability when a very large number of SNPs are used in the analysis; and (2) whether estimation of heritability may be biased, in real studies, by low levels of residual hidden relatedness.

These simulations help to address the important question about whether today's GWAS SNPs will remain useful for imputing causal variants that are discovered using very large sample sizes in future studies of height, or whether the causal variants themselves will need to be genotyped de novo in order to build a prediction model that ultimately captures a large fraction of the variability of height, and by implication other complex phenotypes.

Our overall conclusions are that when study sizes are quite large (5,000 or so) the additive heritability estimate for height is not apparently biased upwards using the linear mixed model; however there is evidence in our simulation that a very large number of causal variants (many thousands) each with very small effect on phenotypic variance will need to be discovered to fill the gap between the heritability explained by known versus unknown causal variants.

Using two mouse models to deplete ILC2s in vivo, we demonstrate that T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses are impaired in the absence of ILC2s. We show that MHCII-expressing ILC2s interact with antigen-specific T cells to instigate a dialog in which IL-2 production from T cells promotes ILC2 proliferation and IL-13 production.

Microbial communication, cooperation and cheating: quorum sensing drives the evolution of cooperation in bacteria. 2009 Aug 17 Authors: Tamás Czárán, Rolf F Hoekstra Abstract: An increasing body of empirical evidence suggests that cooperation among clone-mates is common in bacteria. Bacterial cooperation may take the form of the excretion of "public goods": exoproducts such as virulence factors, exoenzymes or components of the matrix in biofilms, to yield significant benefit for individuals joining in the common effort of producing them.

Supposedly in order to spare unnecessary costs when the population is too sparse to supply the sufficient exoproduct level, many bacteria have evolved a simple chemical communication system called quorum sensing (QS), to "measure" the population density of clone-mates in their close neighborhood.

ved a simple chemical communication system called quorum sensing (QS), to "measure" the population density of clone-mates in their close neighborhood. Cooperation genes are expressed only above a threshold rate of QS signal molecule re-capture, i.e., above the local quorum of cooperators. The cooperative population is exposed to exploitation by cheaters, i.e., mutants who contribute less or nil to the effort but fully enjoy the benefits of cooperation.

ly signaling cooperators, the empirical fact of the existence of both bacterial cooperation and the associated QS communication system seems puzzling. Using a stochastic cellular automaton approach and allowing mutations in an initially non-cooperating, non-communicating strain we show that both cooperation and the associated communication system can evolve, spread and remain persistent. The QS genes help cooperative behavior to invade the population, and vice versa; cooperation and communication might have evolved synergistically in bacteria.

Loss of miR-181a/b-1 resulted in inefficient de novo generation of Treg cells in the thymus but simultaneously permitted homeostatic expansion in the periphery in the absence of competition. Modulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strength in vivo indicated that miR-181a/b-1 controlled Treg-cell formation via establishing adequate signaling thresholds.

We showed that the expression of PSMB8 was upregulated by PRRSV infection, and knockdown of PSMB8 inhibited PRRSV replication by promoting IFN-I production.

The absence of differences between QTL groups in controls, 1 and 7 dpc indicates that the QTL genotype does not affect miRNA expression in healthy fish or their first response to viral infections. The miRNA differences at 20 dpc were associated with the QTL genotype and could, possibly, contribute to differences in resistance/susceptibility at the later stage of infection.

In order to investigate the reasons for the mobility of public good genes, we designed a synthetic bacterial system where we control and quantify the transfer of public good production genes. In our recent study, we have experimentally shown that horizontal transfer helps maintain public good production in the face of both non-producer organisms and non-producer plasmids.

erimentally shown that horizontal transfer helps maintain public good production in the face of both non-producer organisms and non-producer plasmids. Transfer spreads genes to neighboring cells, thus increasing relatedness and directing a higher proportion of public good benefits to producers. The effect is the strongest when public good genes undergo epidemics dynamics, making horizontal transfer especially relevant for pathogenic bacteria that repeatedly infect new hosts and base their virulence on costly public goods.

Previously we have shown that, by using the immunodominant epitope OVA323-339, peptide immunotherapy in a murine model of OVA induced allergic asthma, stimulated OVA-specific Th2 cells, and deteriorated airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia.

These peptide analogues were used for immunotherapy by s.c. injection in OVA-sensitized mice before OVA challenge. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, treatment with the Th2-skewing wild-type peptide and a Th2-skewing partial agonistic peptide (335N-A) dramatically increased airway eosinophilia upon OVA challenge.

the Th2-skewing wild-type peptide and a Th2-skewing partial agonistic peptide (335N-A) dramatically increased airway eosinophilia upon OVA challenge. In contrast, treatment with a Th1-skewing peptide analogue (336E-A) resulted in a significant decrease in airway eosinophilia and OVA-specific IL-4 and IL-5 production. Our data show for the first time that a Th1-skewing peptide analogue of a dominant allergen epitope can modulate allergen-specific Th2 effector cells in an allergic response in vivo.

De novo synthesis of a large number of RepA molecules is required for replication, suggesting that copy number control is exercised at multiple steps. In this theoretical kinetic study we analyse R1 multistep copy number control and show that it results in the insensitive replication response found experimentally but that it at the same time effectively prohibits the existence of only one plasmid copy in a dividing cell. In combination with the partition system of R1, this can lead to very high segregational stability.

The R1 control mechanism is compared to the different multistep copy number control of plasmid ColE1 that is based on conventional sensitivity amplification. This implies that while copy number control for ColE1 efficiently corrects for fluctuations that have already occurred, R1 copy number control prevents their emergence in cells that by chance start their cycle with only one plasmid copy.

eick Jensen, Sander Granneman Abstract: The interaction between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their RNA substrates exhibits fluidity and complexity. Within its lifespan, a single RNA can be bound by many different RBPs that will regulate its production, stability, activity, and degradation. As such, much has been done to understand the dynamics that exist between these two types of molecules. A particularly important breakthrough came with the emergence of 'cross-linking and immunoprecipitation' (CLIP).

This technique allowed stringent investigation into which RNAs are bound by a particular RBP. In short, the protein of interest is UV cross-linked to its RNA substrates in vivo, purified under highly stringent conditions, and then the RNAs covalently cross-linked to the protein are converted into cDNA libraries and sequenced.

Proteolytic cleavage of CD46 occurs upon costimulation and is important for T-cell activation and IL-10 production. The observation that CD46 cleavage was reduced when PBMCs were costimulated compared with purified CD4(+) T cells led us to hypothesize that interactions between different cell types within the PBMCs were able to modulate the CD46 pathway.

purified CD4(+) T cells led us to hypothesize that interactions between different cell types within the PBMCs were able to modulate the CD46 pathway. We show that CD46 downregulation is also reduced when CD4(+) T cells are cocultured with autologous monocytes. Indeed, monocyte: T-cell cocultures impaired CD46-mediated T-cell differentiation and coactivation, by reducing downregulation of surface CD46, lowering induction of the early activation marker CD69, as well as reducing the levels of IL-10 secretion.

We observe enrichment for cardiac muscle developmental/contractile and cytoskeletal genes, highlighting key regulation processes for atrioventricular conduction. Additionally, 8 loci not previously reported harbor genes underlying inherited arrhythmic syndromes and/or cardiomyopathies suggesting a role for these genes in cardiovascular pathology in the general population.

MCMV mutants lacking M45 or expressing C-terminally truncated M45 proteins induced neither NF-kB activation nor transcription of NF-kB-dependent genes within the first 3 h of infection. Rapid NF-kB activation was absent in MCMV-infected NEMO-deficient fibroblasts, indicating that activation occurs at or upstream of the IKK complex.

NF-kB activation was strongly reduced in murine fibroblasts lacking receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a known M45-interacting protein, but was restored upon complementation with murine RIP1.

r studying norovirus biology. While MNV isolates vary in their pathogenesis, infection of immunocompetent mice mostly results in persistent infection. The ability of a virus to establish a persistent infection is dependent on its ability to subvert or avoid the host immune response. Previously, we described the identification and characterization of virulence factor 1 (VF1) in MNV, and demonstrated its role as an innate immune antagonist. Here, we explore the role of VF1 during persistent MNV infection in an immunocompetent host.

Using reverse genetics, we generated MNV-3 viruses carrying a single or a triple termination codon inserted in the VF1 ORF. VF1-deleted MNV-3 replicated to comparable levels to the wildtype virus in tissue culture. Comparative studies between MNV-3 and an acute MNV-1 strain show that MNV-3 VF1 exerts the same functions as MNV-1 VF1, but with reduced potency.

In contrast with naturally occurring Tregs, iTregs resisted conversion to an IL-17-producing phenotype but were able to express T-bet and to produce IFN-g. iTregs initiated their T-bet expression during their in vitro induction, and this was dependent on exposure to IFN-g.

The reduction of macrophage NF-kB activation occurs through a blockade in transforming growth factor b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and IKKb activation. As a consequence, NF-kB (p65) phosphorylation is reduced, its translocation to the nucleus is inhibited and NF-kB-mediated inflammatory cytokine transcription is suppressed.

plement is associated with various pathologies, and the clinical demand for compounds that can regulate complement activation is therefore imperative. Cp40, an analog of the peptide compstatin, inhibits all complement pathways at the level of the central component C3. We have further developed Cp40, using either PEGylation at the N-terminus or insertion of charged amino acids at the C-terminus. The PEGylated analogs are highly soluble and retained their inhibitory activity, with C3b binding affinity dependent on the length of the PEG chain.

. The PEGylated analogs are highly soluble and retained their inhibitory activity, with C3b binding affinity dependent on the length of the PEG chain. The addition of two or three residues of lysine, in turn, not only improved the peptide's solubility but also increased the binding affinity for C3b while retaining its inhibitory potency. Three of the new derivatives showed improved pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo in non-human primates.

Leu-140Phe lies in alphaD adjacent to the DNA-binding motif in the C-terminal domain, like a previously characterized PrfA* mutation (Gly-145Ser). Ile-45Ser, in contrast, maps to the N-terminal beta-roll, a structure similar to that of the Crp cAMP binding site.

recombinant PrfA*(I45S) and PrfA*(G145S) were compared to those of PrfA(WT) at two differentially regulated PrfA-dependent promoters, PplcA and PactA. The two PrfA* mutations increased the affinity for the target DNA to a different extent, and the differences in DNA binding (PrfA*(G145S) > PrfA*(I45S) >>> PrfA(WT)) correlated with proportional differences in transcriptional activity. The use of the PrfA* proteins revealed that PplcA had a greater affinity for, and was more sensitive to, PrfA than PactA.

RNA polymerase (RNAP) initiated transcription independently of PrfA at PplcA, but not at PactA, consistent with bandshift experiments suggesting that PplcA has a greater affinity for RNAP than PactA. Thus, differences in affinity for both PrfA and RNAP appear to determine the different expression pattern of PrfA-regulated promoters.

Modelling of the PrfA* mutations in the crystal structure of PrfA and comparison with structure-function analyses of Crp, in which similar mutations lead to constitutively active (cAMP-independent) Crp* proteins, suggested that PrfA shares with Crp an analogous mechanism of cofactor-mediated allosteric shift.

13 common species of equine small strongyles (cyathostomins) and to discriminate them from three Strongylus spp. (large strongyles) was demonstrated. The assay relied on the specific hybridization of PCR-amplified intergenic spacer DNA fragments of the nuclear ribosomal DNA to membrane-bound species-specific probes. All cyathostomins examined were unequivocally identified and simultaneously discriminated from each other and from three large strongyles (Strongylus edentatus, Strongylus equinus, and Strongylus vulgaris).
