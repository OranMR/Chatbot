: Breedand prion protein (PRNP) genotype-related disease phenotype variability has been observed in sheep infected with the 87V murine scrapie strain. Therefore, the stability of this strain was tested by inoculating sheep-derived 87V brain material back into VM mice. As some sheep-adapted 87V disease phenotypes were reminiscent of CH1641 scrapie, transgenic mice (Tg338) expressing ovine prion protein (PrP) were inoculated with the same sheep-derived 87V sources and with CH1641.

Although at first passage in VM mice the sheep-derived 87V sources showed some divergence from the murine 87V control, all the characteristics of murine 87V infection were recovered at second passage from all sheep sources.

These included 100 % attack rates and indistinguishable survival times, lesion profiles, immunohistochemical features of disease-associated PrP accumulation in the brain and PrP biochemical properties. All sheep-derived 87V sources, as well as CH1641, were transmitted to Tg338 mice with identical clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical features.

While this might potentially indicate that sheep-adapted 87V and CH1641 are the same strain, profound divergences were evident, as murine 87V was unable to infect Tg338 mice but was lethal for VM mice, while the reverse was true for CH1641.

These combined data suggest that: (i) murine 87V is stable and retains its properties after passage in sheep; (ii) it can be isolated from sheep showing a CH1641-like or a more conventional scrapie phenotype; and (iii) sheep-adapted 87V scrapie, with conventional or CH1641-like phenotype, is biologically distinct from experimental CH1641 scrapie, despite the fact that they behave identically in a single transgenic mouse line.

However, the host and pathogens are situated in a continuous arms race which shapes host evolution toward optimized immune responses and the pathogens toward enhanced immune-evasive properties.

ct: Health challenges and health systems set-ups differ, warranting contextualised healthcare interventions to move towards universal health coverage. As such, there is emphasis on generation of contextualized evidence to solve local challenges. However, weak research capacity and inadequate resources remain an impendiment to quality research in the African region. WHO African Region (WHO AFR) facilitated the adoption of a regional strategy for strengthening national health research systems (NHRS) in 2015.

Streptococcus agalactiae has been considered an obligate intramammary and strictly contagious pathogen in dairy cattle. However, recent reports of S. agalactiae isolation from extramammary sources have contradicted that premise. To gain further insight into the epidemiology of S. agalactiae infection in cattle, we examined its distribution and heterogeneity of strains in bovine milk, bovine feces, and the environment in Colombian dairy farms. First, a longitudinal study was conducted at herd level in 152 dairy herds.

chains of the classical class II MHC molecules are DRA and DRB and DQA and DQB. Previous analyses described the duplication of the DQA and DQB genes. The majority of haplotypes include DQA1 and DQA2 loci, however, in a number of haplotypes, DQA1 appears absent and these haplotypes have been described as DQA1 null. In these haplotypes, the DQA2 locus is found in combination with a second locus which appeared more closely related to DQA2 than DQA1, hence the description of this locus as DQA2-like.

It is a priority to define a small VAR2CSA fragment that can be used in an adhesion blocking vaccine. In this, the obvious approach is to define regions of VAR2CSA involved in receptor binding. It has been shown that full-length recombinant VAR2CSA binds specifically to CSA with nanomolar affinity, and that the CSA-binding site lies in the N-terminal part of the protein.

In this study we define the minimal binding region by truncating VAR2CSA and analyzing CSA binding using biosensor technology. We show that the core CSA-binding site lies within the DBL2X domain and parts of the flanking interdomain regions.

Small-angle x-ray scattering measurements enabled modeling of VAR2CSA and showed that the CSA-binding DBL2X domain is situated in the center of the structure. Mutating classic sulfate-binding sites in VAR2CSA, along with testing dependence of ionic interactions, suggest that the CSA binding is not solely dependent on the sulfated CSA structure.

heir three-dimensional structures are similar in that they consist of an a-helix and three anti-parallel b-strands stabilized by four disulfide bonds. Plant defensins MsDef1 and MtDef4 are potent inhibitors of the growth of several filamentous fungi including Fusarium graminearum. However, they differ markedly in their antifungal properties as well as modes of antifungal action. MsDef1 induces prolific hyperbranching of fungal hyphae, whereas MtDef4 does not.

Both defensins contain a highly conserved g-core motif (GXCX(3-9)C), a hallmark signature present in the disulfide-stabilized antimicrobial peptides, composed of b2 and b3 strands and the interposed loop. The g-core motifs of these two defensins differ significantly in their primary amino acid sequences and in their net charge.

To investigate the effects of introducing potentially stabilizing S-S bridges in these different multimeric enzymes, cysteine residues predicted to form inter or intra-subunit disulfide bonds were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Inter-subunit S-S bonds were formed in two NAAAR variants (A68C-D72C and P60C-Y100C) and two d-NCAase variants (A302C and P295C-F304C).

More importantly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that, at the late stage of KSHV reactivation, KDM4A determines the fates of PEL cells, as evidenced by two distinct cell populations; one with less apoptotic signaling expresses high levels of viral genes and the other is exactly opposite, while KDM4A-K417R-expressing cells contain only the apoptotic population with less viral gene expression. Consistently, KDM4A knockout significantly reduced cell viability and virus production in KSHV-reactivated PEL cells.

PTPN22 colocalized with its substrates at the leading edge of cells migrating on surfaces coated with the LFA-1 ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).

C during the lambing season: females that gave birth, and particularly those that weaned a lamb, had higher FEC than females that failed to reproduce. Structural equation modelling revealed future reproductive costs: a positive effect of reproduction on spring FEC and a negative effect on summer body weight were negatively associated with overwinter survival. Overall, we provide evidence that parasite resistance and body weight are important mediators of survival costs of reproduction.

They can be infected with influenza virus and consequently macrophage infection is likely to have an impact on the host immune response. Macrophages display a range of functional phenotypes, from the prototypical pro-inflammatory classically activated cell to alternatively activated anti-inflammatory macrophages involved in immune regulation and wound healing.

Classically activated BMDMs express the pro-inflammatory markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and TNF-a, and TNF-a expression was further upregulated following infection. Alternatively activated macrophages express Arginase-1 and CD206; however, following infection, expression of these markers was downregulated whilst expression of iNOS and TNF-a was upregulated.

When the immunized-mice were induced to develop EAE, these cells secreted significantly higher levels of IL-10 and produced lower levels of IL-6, leading to decreased secretion of IL-17 and IFN-g from MOG-specific CD4(+) T cells.

s (EAE) is essential for the resolution of disease. CNS Treg cells have been shown to uniformly express the Th1-associated molecules, T-bet and CXCR3. Here, we report that the expression of T-bet is not required for the function of these Treg within the CNS. Using mice that lacked T-bet expression specifically within the Treg compartment, we demonstrate that there was no deficit in Treg recruitment into the CNS during EAE and no difference in the resolution of disease compared to control mice.

Additionally, delayed induction of the IL-12Rb2 receptor component after STAT1 activation helped ensure that Treg cells do not readily complete STAT4-dependent Th1 cell development and lose their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation.

. While more than 30 proteins involved in kDNA replication have been described, only few components of kDNA segregation machinery are currently known. Electron microscopy studies identified a high-order structure, the tripartite attachment complex (TAC), linking the basal body of the flagellum via the mitochondrial membranes to the kDNA. Here we describe TAC102, a novel core component of the TAC, which is essential for proper kDNA segregation during cell division.

Loss of TAC102 leads to mitochondrial genome missegregation but has no impact on proper organelle biogenesis and segregation.

We have made a detailed sequence and structural comparison of human FKBP domains. These data show that the chemical scaffolds common to the immunosuppressive inhibitors FK506 and rapamycin bind to the most conserved region of the binding site. This observation opens the way to the design of isoform specific inhibitors.

Targeting proteins to the glycosomes of African trypanosomes. 1994 Authors: J M Sommer, C C Wang Abstract: Glycosomes are microbodies found in protozoa belonging to the order Kinetoplastida. These highly specialized organelles compartmentalize most of the glycolytic enzymes normally located in the cytosol of other eukaryotic cells. The recent success in expressing foreign proteins in Trypanosoma brucei has permitted a detailed analysis of glycosomal protein targeting signals in these organisms.

ess in expressing foreign proteins in Trypanosoma brucei has permitted a detailed analysis of glycosomal protein targeting signals in these organisms. These studies have revealed that the previously identified C-terminal tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal also functions in the import of proteins into the glycosomes of T. brucei. However, the glycosomal and peroxisomal targeting signals differ in a few important ways. The C-terminal tripeptide sequence requirements for glycosomal protein targeting are comparatively relaxed.

TCR signals mediated by Src family kinases are essential for the survival of naive T cells. 2002 Sep 15 Authors: Benedict Seddon, Rose Zamoyska Abstract: The role of TCR signals triggered by recognition of self MHCs in maintaining the survival of naive peripheral T cells remains controversial. Here we examine the role of the Src family kinases, p56(lck) (Lck) and p59(fyn) (Fyn), in the survival of naive T cells.

Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation.

T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites.

Locomotor activity was diurnal, inversely related to melatonin secretion, and prolactin levels were increased under long days. All clock genes were expressed in the ovine SCN and PT. In the SCN, there was a 24-h rhythm in Clock expression, in parallel with Bmal1, in antiphase with cycles in Per1 and Per2; there was low-amplitude oscillation of Cry1 and Cry2.

The waveform of only Per1 and Per2 expression was affected by photoperiod, with extended elevated expression under long days. In the PT, the high-amplitude 24-h cycles in the expression of Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2, but not CK1 epsilon, were influenced by photoperiod. Per1 and Per2 peaked during the day, whereas Cry1 and Cry2 peaked early in the night.

his coordination is disrupted, parasites suffer a 50% reduction in both asexual stages and sexual stage gametocytes over the acute phase of infection. Reduced gametocyte density may not simply follow from a loss of asexuals because investment into gametocytes ("conversion rate") is a plastic trait; furthermore, the densities of both asexuals and gametocytes are highly dynamic during infection. Hence, the reasons for the reduction of gametocytes in infections that are out-of-synch with host circadian rhythms remain unclear.

Providing superphysiological GITR costimulation using an agonistic anti-GITR mAb over the first 12 d of L. sigmodontis infection initially increased the quantity of Th2 cells, as well as their ability to produce Th2 cytokines. However, as infection progressed, the Th2 responses reverted to normal infection levels, and parasite killing remained unaffected.

A high-mannose microarray shows that all substructures are bound by FimH and that the largest oligomannose is not necessarily the best binder. Affinity measurements demonstrate a strong preference towards oligomannosides exposing Manalpha1-3Man at their non-reducing end.

In particular, we tested if this viability (estimated via infectivity) depended on host genotype, whether or not the genotype was susceptible, and on initial parasite dose. Our results show that Pasteuria spores generally remain viable after passage through both susceptible and resistant Daphnia.

The exact role that each of these Tam proteins plays in tambjamine biosynthesis is not known.

RhoA inhibition restored the phagocytic phenotype to that seen in control macrophages. In summary, we identify a surprising gain of antibacterial function due to loss of BMAL1 in macrophages, associated with a RhoA-dependent cytoskeletal change, an increase in cell motility, and gain of phagocytic function.

Burt, Mark P Stevens, Helen M Sang, David A Hume Abstract: Macrophages have many functions in development and homeostasis as well as innate immunity. Recent studies in mammals suggest that cells arising in the yolk sac give rise to self-renewing macrophage populations that persist in adult tissues. Macrophage proliferation and differentiation is controlled by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) and interleukin 34 (IL34), both agonists of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R).

Interestingly, the Q129H mutation severely impaired intranuclear processing of progeny virions compared to the wild-type ORF37, as assessed by pulsed-field and Gardella gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and single-molecule analysis of replicating DNA (SMARD) assays.

)-associated herpesvirus is the causative agent of multiple malignancies, predominantly in immunocompromised individuals, including HIV/AIDS patients. Reduced incidence of KS in HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiherpetic drugs to block lytic replication confirms the role of lytic DNA replication and gene products in KSHV-mediated tumorigenesis. Herpesvirus lytic replication results in the production of complex concatemeric DNA, which is cleaved into unit length viral DNA for packaging into the infectious virions.

Using a LacZ selection marker developed for R. equi in this study, in combination with an apramycin resistance gene, an efficient two-stage homologous recombination targeted gene mutation procedure was used to mutate three virulence plasmid genes, a LysR regulatory gene homologue (ORF4), a ResD-like two-component response regulator homologue (ORF8), and a gene (ORF10) of unknown function that is highly expressed by R.

Virulence testing by liver clearance after intravenous injection in mice showed that the ORF4 and ORF8 mutants were fully attenuated, that the phoPR mutant was hypervirulent, and that virulence of the ORF10 mutant remained unchanged.

t the ORF4 and ORF8 mutants were fully attenuated, that the phoPR mutant was hypervirulent, and that virulence of the ORF10 mutant remained unchanged. A virulence plasmid DNA microarray was used to compare the plasmid gene expression profile of each of the four gene-targeted mutants against the parental R. equi strain. Changes were limited to PI genes and gene induction was observed for all mutants, suggesting that expression of virulence plasmid genes is dominated by a negative regulatory network.

The finding of attenuation of ORF4 and ORF8 mutants despite enhanced transcription of vapA suggests that factors other than VapA are important for full expression of virulence. ORF1, a putative Lsr antigen gene, was strongly and similarly induced in all mutants, implying a common regulatory pathway affecting this gene for all four mutated genes.

ncephalopathy (TSE) agents accumulate first in lymphoid tissues before spreading to the CNS (termed neuroinvasion) where they cause neurodegeneration. Early TSE agent accumulation upon follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in lymphoid follicles appears critical for efficient neuroinvasion. Most clinical cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have occurred in young adults, although the reasons behind this apparent age-related susceptibility are uncertain. Host age has a significant influence on immune function.

As FDC status and immune complex trapping is reduced in aged mice (600 days old), we hypothesized that this aging-related decline in FDC function might impair TSE pathogenesis. We show that coincident with the effects of host age on FDC status, the early TSE agent accumulation in the spleens of aged mice was significantly impaired.

We attribute this to the highest levels of nontarget-site resistance being achieved by fixing mutations that more broadly affect cellular physiology, which results in both more cross-resistance and less overall antagonistic pleiotropy on maximum growth rate.

We demonstrate a history of extensive genome fluctuation for this species and show that individual lineages could have acquired thousands of genes in the same period in which a 1% amino acid divergence accrues in the core genome. Elucidating the dynamics of genome fluctuation reveals the rapid turnover of gained genes, such that the majority of recently gained genes are quickly lost.

ating the dynamics of genome fluctuation reveals the rapid turnover of gained genes, such that the majority of recently gained genes are quickly lost. Despite high observed rates of fluctuation, a phylogeny inferred from patterns of gene occurrence is similar to a phylogeny based on amino acid replacements within the core genome. Furthermore, the core genome phylogeny suggests that P. syringae should be considered a number of distinct species, with levels of divergence at least equivalent to those between recognized bacterial species.

However, the emergence of drug-resistant parasites has stimulated the search for alternative control strategies to curb production losses. Lambs become infected soon after weaning and begin to control parasite burden within 8-10 weeks of continual infection. This control is an acquired characteristic mediated by the development of parasite-specific antibodies.

Consequently, these parasites require assimilating NAD+ precursors (nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide riboside) from their host environment to synthesize NAD+ by a salvage pathway. Nicotinamidase is a key enzyme of this salvage pathway that catalyses conversion of nicotinamide (NAm) to nicotinic acid (Na), and that is absent in higher eukaryotes.

The Long Wait for a New Drug for Human African Trypanosomiasis. 2018 Oct Authors: Catriona H Baker, Susan C Welburn Abstract: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is responsible for around 3000 reported cases each year. Treatments for HAT are expensive and problematic to administer, and available drugs are old and less than ideal, some with high levels of toxicity that result in debilitating and, in some cases, fatal side effects. Treatment options are limited, with only one drug, eflornithine, introduced in the last 28 years.

Here we examine the limitations of current chemotherapeutic approaches to manage HAT, the constraints to new drug development exploring drug failures and new drugs on the horizon, and consider the epidemiological, political, social, and economic factors influencing drug development.

MacDonald Abstract: Fine control of macrophage activation is needed to prevent inflammatory disease, particularly at barrier sites such as the lungs. However, the dominant mechanisms that regulate the activation of pulmonary macrophages during inflammation are poorly understood. We found that alveolar macrophages (AlvMs) were much less able to respond to the canonical type 2 cytokine IL-4, which underpins allergic disease and parasitic worm infections, than macrophages from lung tissue or the peritoneal cavity.

Expression of this protein is induced by exposure to oxidative stress, high temperatures, and low pHs, which reflect the conditions encountered by R. equi when it enters the host environment. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LysR-type transcriptional regulator VirR, which is encoded by the virulence plasmid, is required for the expression of vapA.
