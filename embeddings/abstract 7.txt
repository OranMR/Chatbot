Many natural prion diseases are acquired peripherally, such as by oral exposure, lesions to skin or mucous membranes, and possibly also via the nasal cavity. Following peripheral exposure, some prions accumulate to high levels within the secondary lymphoid organs as they make their journey from the site of infection to the brain, a process termed neuroinvasion.

How independent are TSE agents from their hosts? 2013 Authors: Robert A Somerville Abstract: Central to understanding the nature TSE agents (or prions) is how their genetic information is distinguished from the host. Are TSEs truly infectious diseases with host-independent genomes, or are they aberrations of a host component derived from the host genome? Recent experiments tested whether glycosylation of host PrP affects TSE strain characteristics.

Wild-type mice were infected with 3 TSE strains passaged through transgenic mice with PrP devoid of glycans at 1 or both N-glycosylation sites. Strain-specific characteristics of 1 TSE strain changed but did not change for 2 others. Changes resulted from the selection of mutant TSE strains in a novel replicative environment.

Since binding of mFX to HAdV-5 blocks the neutralization cascade, these findings suggested that not all complement-binding sites may be involved in virion neutralization. Furthermore, the data obtained from serum neutralization experiments suggested that immune molecules other than IgM and IgG may trigger activation of the complement cascade in vitro.

Recognition of Gram-positive organisms by Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 induces proinflammatory gene expression by diverse cells. We hypothesized that IEC are unresponsive to Gram-positive pathogen-associated molecular patterns and sought to characterize the functional responses of IEC to TLR2-specific ligands.

Three of these miRNAs were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in infected cells by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR and Northern blot analyses, and one of them, miR-532-5p, exhibited a significant antiviral effect against WNVKUN infection. We have demonstrated that miR-532-5p targets and downregulates expression of the host genes SESTD1 and TAB3 in human cells.

HBD3 is present on a highly copy number variable block of six b-defensin genes, and increased copy number is associated with the autoimmune disease psoriasis. It is not known how this increase influences disease development, but psoriasis is a T cell-mediated disease and activation of the innate immune system is required for the initial trigger that leads to the amplification stage.

The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5'-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis ("cap-snatching").

We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named "start-snatching." Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral "untranslated regions" (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting.

We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that during infection with IAV, and likely a multitude of other human, animal and plant viruses, a host-dependent mechanism allows the genesis of hybrid genes.

These phenotypes in intracellular survival and cell to cell spread are not due to the loss of expression and polar localization of the BimA protein on the surface of intracellular bacteria, however they do correlate with an inability of the bacteria to recruit and polymerize actin. Furthermore, we also establish a role for <i>bimC</i> in virulence of <i>B.

We found that the type III secretion system of <i>B. pseudomallei</i> was activated, and a variety of effector proteins were highly upregulated. Among them, BopE, BprD, and BipC were shown to interact with Rab32. Interestingly, BopE directly interacts with host Rab32, potentially suppressing Rab32 function by interfering with nucleotide exchange, which in turn restricts the recruitment of Rab32 to bacterial-containing vesicles.

Dermal Langerin(+) DCs migrate from the skin to the LNs after inflammation and in the steady state, and represent the majority of Langerin(+) DCs in skin draining LNs.

Both epidermal and dermal Langerin(+) DCs were depleted by treatment with diphtheria toxin in Lang-DTREGFP knock-in mice. In contrast, transgenic hLang-DTA mice lack epidermal LCs, but have normal numbers of dermal Langerin(+) DCs. CHS responses were abrogated upon depletion of both epidermal and dermal LCs, but were unaffected in the absence of only epidermal LCs.

Deletion of O-island 51, a 14.93 kb cryptic prophage (CP-933C), resulted in a reduction in LEE expression and T3S. The deletion also had a reduced capacity to attach to epithelial cells and significantly reduced E. coli O157 excretion levels from sheep. Further characterization of O-island 51 identified a novel positive regulator of the LEE, encoded by ecs1581 in the E.

his longer boTLR1 with boTLR2 now resulted in the recognition of triacylated lipopeptides by HEK293 cells, thereby resembling the ex vivo observation. Analysis of the structure-activity relationship showed that the ester-bound acid chains of these lipopeptides need to consist of at least 12 carbon atoms to activate the bovine heterodimer showing similarity to the recognition by huTLR2/huTLR1. In contrast, HEK293 cell cotransfected with muTLR2 and muTLR1 could already be activated by lipopeptides with shorter fatty acids of only 6 carbon atoms.

Despite COPA and COPB2 being reported to function in the same complex, knockdown of these genes produced distinct phenotypes. Furthermore, knockdown of COPA caused increased expression of viral late genes despite substantial inhibition of viral DNA replication. This suggests that efficient viral genome replication is not required for late gene expression.

Detailed investigation of the PfEMP1 binding site on IgM showed that some of the critical amino acids in the IgM Cmu4 domain are equivalent to those regions of IgG and IgA recognized by Fc-binding proteins from bacteria, suggesting that this region of Ig molecules may be of major functional significance in host-microbe interactions.

ERCC1-XPF (ERCC1-ERCC4) repairs cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adducts and interstrand crosslinks and its specific inhibition has been shown to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity in cancer cells.

Following isolation of the cDNA from the liver of an uninfected bird, a number of unique sequence features were identified. The predicted protein has a longer NH(2)-terminus than the human protein; however, as in mammals, this region contains neither a prodomain nor a signal peptide.

We recently revealed a major role for IL-4 in the proliferative expansion of resident MFs during a Th2-biased tissue nematode infection. We now show that proliferation of MFs during intestinal as well as tissue nematode infection is restricted to sites of IL-4 production and requires MF-intrinsic IL-4R signaling.

However, both IL-4Ra-dependent and -independent mechanisms contributed to MF proliferation during nematode infections. IL-4R-independent proliferation was controlled by a rise in local CSF-1 levels, but IL-4Ra expression conferred a competitive advantage with higher and more sustained proliferation and increased accumulation of IL-4Ra(+) compared with IL-4Ra(-) cells.

Finally, although both elevated CSF1R and IL-4Ra signaling triggered proliferation above homeostatic levels, only CSF-1 led to the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils.

Imaging plasmodesmata. 2011 Jan Authors: Karen Bell, Karl Oparka Abstract: At only 50 nm in diameter, plasmodesmata (PD) are below the limit of resolution of conventional light microscopy. Consequently, much of our current interpretation of the substructure of PD is derived from transmission electron microscopy. However, PD can be imaged with alternative techniques, including field emission scanning electron microscopy and 'super-resolution' imaging approaches such as 3D-structured illumination microscopy.

e immune composition of the tumor microenvironment regulates processes including angiogenesis, metastasis, and the response to drugs or immunotherapy. To facilitate the characterization of the immune component of tumors from transcriptomics data, a number of immune cell transcriptome signatures have been reported that are made up of lists of marker genes indicative of the presence a given immune cell population.

Although research on EV-associated RNA has predominantly focused on microRNAs, the transcriptome of EV consists of multiple classes of small non-coding RNAs with potential gene-regulatory functions.

Immune stimulus-specific changes were found in the miRNA, snoRNA, and Y-RNA content of EV from dendritic cells, whereas tRNA and snRNA levels were much less affected. Only part of the changes in EV-RNA content reflected changes in cellular RNA, which urges caution in interpreting EV as snapshots of cells.

FoxP3-expressing CD4 T-cells, so-called regulatory T-cells (T<sub>regs</sub> ), have an important contribution in the regulation of immune responses; and, in recent years, it has been suggested that T<sub>regs</sub> next to an immune-regulatory, 'damage-limiting' function may also have an immune-independent 'damage-resolving' direct role in wound healing.

In particular, the release of the epidermal growth factor-like growth factor Amphiregulin by tissue-resident T<sub>regs</sub> during wound repair suggested such a function. Our recent findings have now revealed that Amphiregulin induces the local release of bio-active transforming growth factor (TGF)b, a cytokine involved both in immune regulation as well as in the process of wound repair.

Furthermore, we propose that T<sub>reg</sub> -derived Amphiregulin in an autocrine way may enable an IL-33-mediated survival and expansion of tissue-resident T<sub>regs</sub> upon injury.

The discovery of dendritic cells as major antigen-presenting cells and their surface expression of pattern recognition receptors revealed the mechanisms by which innate immunity instructs acquired immunity. Genetic analysis provided in-depth insights into the generation of antibody diversity by recombination, which in principle was shown to underlie diversity of the T cell receptor, as well.

Therefore, in a case control field study, we aimed to determine the monthly excretion of C. daubneyi eggs in the feces of dual-purpose dairy cows on two farms in southern Germany over a period of one year, and to compare milk yield and fertility parameters between infected and non-infected cows within the herds. For this purpose, the cows were divided into groups depending on egg excretion (1 = negative; 2 = rumen fluke-positive; 3 = rumen flukeand liver fluke-positive).

To be able to investigate seasonal influences, the data was analysed in three time-intervals (entire study period, summer half-year, winter half-year). A total of 117 cows from the two farms were examined in this study. The in-herd-prevalence for rumen fluke was 57.0 % and 64.0 %, respectively. The median egg excretion was low in both farms (< 6 epg), the maximum excretion reached 92.3 epg.

Cows coinfected with F. hepatica showed the highest rumen fluke egg excretion rate. Calicophoron daubneyi infection had no significant effect on milk production parameters (milk yield, milk fat, milk protein, and somatic cell count).

TB is curable, although treatment is for at least 6 months and longer when disease is drug resistant. If patients miss too many doses (non-adherence), they may transmit infection for longer and the infecting bacteria may develop resistance to the standard drugs used for treatment. Non-adherence may therefore risk both their health and that of others.

The recent finding of pore-forming activities in glycosomal membrane preparations and extensions of the trypanosome glycolysis computer model with size-selective pores sparked again an old debate on the extent of (im)permeability of the glycosomal membrane and whether glycosomally located glycolytic enzymes could and should also be present with some activity in the cytosol.

he only stem cell type able to indefinite self-renewal and to differentiate into cellular derivates of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Recent extensive studies have revealed that ES cells maintain self-renewal and pluripotency because of a self-organizing network of transcription factors and intracellular pathways activated by extracellular signalling that together prevent their differentiation and promote their proliferation, and because of epigenetic processes that maintain the chromatin in a plastic differentiation status.

Primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of gametes, because of their unique ability to retain true developmental totipotency, are considered the mother of all stem cells.

In fact, in normal condition PGCs are believed to differentiate into germ cells only, oogonia/oocytes in the female, and prospermatogonia in the male which ultimately produce eggs and sperm, respectively. It is not until the fertilization of the egg or parthenogenesis that the intrinsic germ cell totipotency program is revealed.

Many aspects of the extrinsic factors and signalling required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency have been identified and dissected. On the other hand, several extrinsic factors controlling PGC development have been identified, but the underlying molecular signalling remains little defined.

The first two growth factors have been demonstrated to control key aspects of the self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. BMP4 and KL are known for their crucial role in regulating various process of PGC development in the embryo from the formation of PGC precursors and PGC specification (BMP4) to their survival, proliferation and migration (KL).

Currently great variability is seen for published correlations between performance and resistance, with estimates appearing to vary with production environment. The model accounted for host genotype and parasitism in a population of lambs, incorporating heritable between-lamb variation in host-parasite interactions, with genetic independence of input growth and immunological variables.

An epidemiological module was linked to the host-parasite interaction module via food intake (FI) to create a grazing scenario. The model was run for a population of lambs growing from 2 mo of age, grazing on pasture initially contaminated with 0, 1,000, 3,000, or 5,000 larvae/kg DM, and given either no anthelmintic treatment or drenched at 30-d intervals.

For non-drenched lambs the maximum mean population values for worm burden (WB) and fecal egg count (FEC) increased and occurred earlier for increasing IL(0), with values being similar for all IL(0) at the end of the simulation.

The heritability of EBW for non-drenched lambs was predicted to be initially high (0.55) and decreased over time with increasing IL(0), whereas drenched lambs remained high throughout. The heritability of WB and FEC for all lambs was initially low (~0.05) and increased with time to ~0.25, with increasing IL(0) leading to this value being reached at faster rates.

The genetic correlation between EBW and FEC was initially ~-0.3. As time progressed the correlation tended towards 0, before becoming negative by the end of the simulation for non-drenched lambs, with increasing IL(0) leading to increasingly negative correlations.

We used optical endomicroscopy to visualize a water-soluble optical imaging probe based on the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin conjugated to an environmentally sensitive fluorophore. The probe was chemically stable and nontoxic and, after in-human intrapulmonary microdosing, enabled the specific detection of Gram-negative bacteria in distal human airways and alveoli within minutes.

We found the melanoma cells were not affected at all by in vivo anti-CD25 mAb administration alone but tumor rejection resulted in all mice when the administration was combined with IL-12 gene transfer to tumor cells. In vivo, depletion of natural killer (NK) cells or CD8(+) T cells cancelled the tumor rejection.

Therefore, we also examined the frequency of the change to a vitiligo-like coat color in mice showing tumor rejection caused by CD25(+) T-cell elimination to compare with the mechanism enhancing the antitumor effects by cell elimination. The elimination of CD25(+) T cells did not induce vitiligo-like coat color changes, though that of CD4(+) T cells induced the change in 60% of mice.

Therefore, mRNA expression of these genes in cell pellets extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and bronchial epithelial brushing (BEB) was compared between 11 clinically healthy (Control group), 7 IADand 12 RAO-affected horses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

We also performed arterial blood gas analysis, endoscopic scoring of mucus accumulation in the trachea and cytology of tracheo-bronchial secretions (TBS) and of BALF. Tracheal mucus accumulation, along with TBS and BALF neutrophils were significantly increased and arterial pO(2) was decreased in RAO-affected horses compared to the Control group.

lic inflammation with prolonged neutrophil survival is common to many inflammatory conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are few specific therapies that reverse neutrophilic inflammation, but uncovering mechanisms regulating neutrophil survival is likely to identify novel therapeutic targets. Screening of 367 kinase inhibitors in human neutrophils and a zebrafish tail fin injury model identified ErbBs as common targets of compounds that accelerated inflammation resolution.

bacterial pathogens, and their secreted products. Neurotransmitters appear to influence epithelial associations with bacteria in the intestinal lumen. For example, internalization of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7 into the Peyer's patch mucosa of the small intestine is altered after the inhibition of neural activity with saxitoxin, a neuronal sodium channel blocker. Catecholamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, also alter bacterial internalization in Peyer's patches.

In the large intestine, norepinephrine increases the mucosal adherence of E. coli. These neurotransmitter actions are mediated by well-defined catecholamine receptors situated on the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells rather than through direct interactions with luminal bacteria.

In addition, with active tuberculosis (TB) as a surrogate for LTBI, it appears that the ELISA has a similar sensitivity to the TST, whereas the ELISpot is more sensitive. Using degree of exposure to TB as a surrogate for LTBI, both assays correlate at least as well with TB exposure as the TST.

Notably, IL-4Ra signalling is sufficient to induce expansion of the tuft cell lineage, and ectopic stimulation of this signalling cascade obviates the need for tuft cells in the epithelial cell remodelling of the intestine. Moreover, tuft cells secrete IL-25, thereby regulating type 2 immune responses.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) DRB3 and DQ genes are polymorphic, but unlike HLA, many BoLA haplotypes have duplicated DQ genes, and antibody-blocking studies indicated that BoLA-DQ molecules present various pathogen epitopes. Limited experimentation also suggested that BoLA-DQ molecules formed by interhaplotype pairing of A and B chains are functional.

The occurrence of apoptosis in unicellular parasites provides a challenge for evolutionary theory to explain as organisms are expected to have evolved to maximise their own proliferation, not death. One possible explanation is that protozoan parasites undergo apoptosis in order to gain a group benefit from controlling their density as this prevents premature vector mortality.

The relatively low prevalence of N. caninum in Irish carnivores suggests that the local ecology of a species has an important influence on its epidemiological role.

mill was investigated to allay concerns of any potential health risks to factory staff, and to inform the unknown risk of downgrading of the product. The approach integrated conventional morphological examination of adult female mites by referring to published identification keys, with molecular speciation based on amplification of a 16S ribosomal DNA fragment. The methods enabled the mites to be unambiguously identified as Dermanyssus gallinae 'special lineage L1'.

Subsequent investigations showed the source of infestation to be pigeons nesting in the air ducts, with the gamasid mites moving into the room once the young birds had fledged. This is the first report of D. gallinae 'special lineage L1' in northern Europe. Previous reports of nosocominal gamasoidosis caused by D.

Lleyn ewes had significantly higher 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 25(OH)D concentrations than both Scottish Blackface ewe genotypes, whereas these vitamin D parameters did not differ significantly between the UBF and IBF ewes. Concentrations of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 25(OH)D were positively associated with subsequent birth weights of singleton and of twin lamb litters.

rate of successful diagnosis remains low. Chlamydia-related organisms including Parachlamydia have recently emerged as putative cattle abortifacients. Placental tissue samples and fetal lung from bovine abortion submissions across Scotland in Spring 2011 were investigated by histopathology for the presence of suspect Chlamydia-related organisms. Evidence of Chlamydia-related organisms was observed in 21/113 (18.6%) placenta samples.
