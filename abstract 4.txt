Changes in C uptake in populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii selected at high CO2. 2006 Sep Authors: Sinéad Collins, Dieter Sültemeyer, Graham Bell Abstract: Estimates of the effect of increased global atmospheric CO(2) levels on oceanic primary productivity depend on the physiological responses of contemporary phytoplankton populations. However, microalgal populations will possibly adapt to rising CO(2) levels in such a way that they become genetically different from contemporary populations.

microalgal populations will possibly adapt to rising CO(2) levels in such a way that they become genetically different from contemporary populations. The unknown properties of these future populations introduce an undefined error into predictions of C pool dynamics, especially the presence and size of the biological C pump. To address the bias in predictions introduced by evolution, we measured the kinetics of CO(2) uptake in populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that had been selected for growth at high CO(2) for 1000 generations.

Following selection at high CO(2), the populations were unable to induce high-affinity CO(2) uptake, and one line had a lower rate of net CO(2) uptake. We attribute this to conditionally neutral mutations in genes affecting the C concentrating mechanism (CCM).

Lower affinity CO(2) uptake, in addition to smaller population sizes, results in a significant reduction in net CO(2) uptake of about 38% relative to contemporary populations under the same conditions.

In the absence of preventive measures, increasing genetic resistance of salmon to AGD via selective breeding can reduce the incidence of the disease and mitigate gill damage. Understanding the mechanisms leading to AGD resistance and the underlying causative genomic features can aid in this effort, while also providing critical information for the development of other control strategies.

R Brown Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, plays a critical role in the orchestration of immune responses. S1P levels within the mammalian host are tightly regulated, in part through the activity of S1P lyase (S1PL) which catalyses its irreversible degradation. Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of secreted S1PL orthologues encoded by the facultative intracellular bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis.

iated host-pathogen interactions and outlining currently available mechanistic insight into increased bacterial virulence in response to host factors. This review aims to define a possibly underestimated theme of chemically mediated host-pathogen interactions and encourage future validation and characterization of the contribution of host chemicals to microbial virulence in vivo. From this perspective, we discuss proposed antivirulence compounds and suggest new potential targets for antimicrobials that prevent chemical-mediated virulence.

However, LL-37 is known to be susceptible to the enzymatic activity of peptidyl arginine deiminases (PAD), and exposure of the peptide to these enzymes results in the conversion of positively charged arginines to neutral citrullines (citrullination). Here, we demonstrate that citrullination of LL-37 reduced its direct antiviral activity against HRV.

Furthermore, while the anti-rhinovirus activity of LL-37 results in dampened epithelial cell inflammatory responses, citrullination of the peptide, and a loss in antiviral activity, ameliorates this effect. This study also demonstrates that HRV infection upregulates PAD2 protein expression, and increases levels of protein citrullination, including histone H3, in human bronchial epithelial cells.

s. CLEC-2 belongs to the Dectin-1 sub-family of CLRs that possess an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain and a single intracellular hemITAM motif. CLEC-2 is highly expressed on mouse and human platelets where it signals via Syk to promote aggregation. We generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against mouse CLEC-2 and found that CLEC-2 is additionally widely expressed on leukocytes and that its expression is upregulated during inflammation.

against mouse CLEC-2 and found that CLEC-2 is additionally widely expressed on leukocytes and that its expression is upregulated during inflammation. MAb-mediated crosslinking of CLEC-2 leads to hemITAM-dependent signaling via Syk, Ca(2+) and NFAT and, in myeloid cells, modulates the effect of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to selectively potentiate production of IL-10. A macrophage/dendritic cell-dependent increase in IL-10 is also observed in mice given anti-CLEC-2 mAb together with LPS.

the enzymology of nematode cuticle collagen biogenesis have been elucidated in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The dpy-31 gene in C. elegans encodes a procollagen C-terminal processing enzyme of the astacin metalloprotease or bone morphogenetic protein class that, when mutated, results in a temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype associated with cuticle defects. In this study, orthologues of this essential gene have been identified in the phylogenetically diverse parasitic nematodes Haemonchus contortus and Brugia malayi.

The DPY-31 protein is expressed in the gut and secretory system of C. elegans, a location also confirmed when a B. malayi transcriptional dpy-31 promoter-reporter gene fusion was expressed in C. elegans. Functional conservation between the nematode enzymes was supported by the fact that heterologous expression of the H. contortus dpy-31 orthologue in a C.

Knowledge of the importance of colostrum consumption by calves is poor. Timely consumption of sufficient colostrum (locally called "phehu") by calves was clearly sub-optimal in the majority of households. The reasons behind this are nuanced, but the practice of collecting colostrum from newly calved cows to make confectionery for human consumption is an important contributory factor.

Care of the umbilicus of the newborn is not routine practice in the locality. Local women are the key group assisting with young and sick animals, including cases of simple dystocia and retained foetal membranes.

Quantifying pathogen transmission in multi-host systems is difficult, as exemplified in bovine tuberculosis (bTB) systems, but is crucial for control. The agent of bTB, <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, persists in cattle populations worldwide, often where potential wildlife reservoirs exist. However, the relative contribution of different host species to bTB persistence is generally unknown. In Britain, the role of badgers in infection persistence in cattle is highly contentious, despite decades of research and control efforts.

To address this, we cloned and sequenced the major surface glycoprotein genes (gB, gC, gD, gE, gH, gI, and gL) of five MDV strains that were representative of the virulent (v), very virulent (vv) and very virulent plus (vv+) pathotypes of MDV.

The glycoprotein genes most similar among MDV-1, MDV-2 and HVT (gB and gC, approximately 81 and 75%, respectively) were among the most conserved across pathotype. We found mutations mapping to the putative signal cleavage site in the gL genes in four out of eleven vv+MDVs, but this mutation was also identified in one vvMDV (643P) indicating that it did not correlate with enhanced virulence.

Likewise, by PCR and RFLP analysis, we found no polymorphism at the locus encoding the pp38 gene, an early lytic-phase gene associated with MDV replication.

In examination of the DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of meq genes from 26 MDV strains (9 m/vMDV, 5 vvMDV and 12 vv+MDVs), we found distinct polymorphism and point mutations that appeared to correlate with virulence. Although a complex trait like MDV virulence is likely to be multigenic, these data describe the first sets of mutations that appear to correlate with MDV virulence.

Our conclusion is that since Meq is expressed primarily in the latent/transforming phase of MDV infection, and is not encoded by MDV-2 or HVT vaccine viruses, the evolution of MDV virulence may be due to selection on MDV-host cell interactions during latency and may not be mediated by the immune selection against virus lytic antigens such as the surface glycoproteins.

By mapping to the A. suum genome, we obtained 494 and 505 miRNA candidates from the female and male parasite, respectively, and 87 and 82 of miRNA candidates were consistent with A. suum miRNAs deposited in the miRBase database. Among the miRNA candidates, 154 were shared by the two genders, and 340 and 351 were female and male specific with their target numbers ranged from one to thousands, respectively.

The rate of phosphorylation is described by the bimolecular inhibitory rate constant (k(i)), which has been used for quantification of OP inhibitory capacity. It has been proposed that a peripheral binding site exists on the AChE molecule, which, when occupied, reduces the capacity of additional oxon molecules to phosphorylate the active site.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) and paraoxon (PO) with rat brain AChE to assess the dynamics of AChE inhibition and the potential role of a peripheral binding site.

At low concentrations, the k(i) estimates were approximately similar for both CPO and PO (150-180 [two determinations] and 300 +/- 180 nM(-1)h(-1), respectively).

The immunodominance of SIINFEKL-specific T cells could not be altered by decreasing the number of SIINFEKL-specific cells available to respond, or by increasing the number of cells specific for endogenous MCMV Ags. In contrast, coinfection with viruses expressing and lacking SIINFEKL enabled coinflation of T cells specific for both SIINFEKL and nonrecombinant Ags.

In this study, an extensive database search identified 39, 43, 34 and 18 RALF genes in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and soybean, respectively. These RALF genes were found to be highly conserved across the 4 plant species.

The helminth <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</i> establishes long-term infections in susceptible C57BL/6 mice, but is slowly expelled in BALB/c mice from day 14 onwards. We noted that IL-25R (<i>Il17rb</i>)-deficient BALB/c mice were unable to expel parasites despite type 2 immune activation comparable to the wild-type.

We then established that in C57BL/6 mice, IL-25 adminstered late in infection (days 14-17) drove immunity. Moreover, when IL-25 and IL-4 were delivered to <i>Rag1</i>-deficient mice, the combination resulted in near complete expulsion of the parasite, even following administration of an anti-CD90 antibody to deplete innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).

These viruses cause huge economic damage to poultry production systems and pose a zoonotic threat both in their own right and in the generation of novel zoonotic viruses, for example, H7N9. In recent years, it has been observed that H9N2 viruses have further adapted to gallinaceous poultry, becoming more highly transmissible and causing higher morbidity and mortality.

Here, we investigate the molecular basis for this increased virulence, comparing a virus from the 1990s and a contemporary field strain. The modern virus replicated to higher titers in various systems, and this difference mapped to a single amino acid polymorphism at position 26 of the endonuclease domain shared by the PA and PA-X proteins.

Although the PA K26E change correlated with increased host cell shutoff activity of the PA-X protein <i>in vitro</i>, it could not be overridden by frameshift site mutations that block PA-X expression and therefore increased PA-X activity could not explain the differences in replication phenotype. Instead, this indicates that these differences are due to subtle effects on PA function.

In the Middle East and South Asia, an older H9N2 virus strain has been replaced by a new reassortant strain with greater fitness. Here, we take representative viruses and investigate the genetic basis for this "fitness." A single mutation in the virus was responsible for greater fitness, enabling high growth of the contemporary H9N2 virus in cells, as well as in chickens.

To be sustainable, AAT control programs need to tailor tsetse control to the inelastic budgets of resource-poor small scale farmers. To guide the process of tsetse and AAT control toolkit selection, that now, more than ever before, needs to optimise resources, the costs of different tsetse and trypanosomiasis control options need to be determined.

gs Abstract: Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is caused by the bacterium <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> subspecies <i>paratuberculosis</i> (<i>Map</i>). Achieving herd-level control of mycobacterial infection is notoriously difficult, despite widespread adoption of test-and-cull-based control strategies. The presence of infection in wildlife populations could be contributing to this difficulty. Rabbits are naturally infected with the same <i>Map</i> strain as cattle, and can excrete high levels in their faeces.

ontributing to this difficulty. Rabbits are naturally infected with the same <i>Map</i> strain as cattle, and can excrete high levels in their faeces. The aim of this study is to determine if implementation of paratuberculosis control in cattle leads to a decline in <i>Map</i> infection levels in rabbits. An island-wide, test-and-cull-based paratuberculosis control programme was initiated on a Scottish island in 2008. In this study annual tests were obtained from 15 cattle farms, from 2008 to 2011, totalling 2609 tests.

Rabbits (1564) were sampled from the 15 participating farms, from 2008 to 2011, and <i>Map</i> was detected by faecal culture. <i>Map</i> seroprevalence in cattle decreased from 16 to 7.2 per cent, while <i>Map</i> prevalence in rabbits increased from 10.3 to 20.3 per cent. Results indicate that efforts to control paratuberculosis in cattle do not reduce <i>Map</i> levels in sympatric rabbits.

All GR cultures contained IFN, but compared with naive mice IL-10 production was accelerated at 8 weeks and abrogated at 20 weeks, consistent with expansion and abatement of Th2 activity. Cytokine neutralization was performed in egg-challenged, naive mice that were adoptively sensitized with lymphoid cells from 8 week-infected donors.

In corresponding LN cultures, IFN decreased by about 50%, while IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-5 increased by nearly two-, four-, fiveand six-fold, respectively. Anti-IL-10 did not affect GR size or GR cytokines, but abrogated GR area by 40%, along with a reduction in local IL-4 and TNF production.

Patients with this disease have mutations in the protein kinase domain of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) which is a tyrosine kinase receptor essential for microglia development. We investigated the effects of these mutations on Csf1r signalling using a factor dependent cell line.

Corresponding mutant forms of murine Csf1r were expressed on the cell surface at normal levels, and bound CSF1, but were not able to sustain cell proliferation. Since Csf1r signaling requires receptor dimerization initiated by CSF1 binding, the data suggest a mechanism for phenotypic dominance of the mutant allele in HDLS.

Appay, Olivier Schwartz, Peter M Kloetzel, Arnaud Moris Abstract: Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) play a critical role in controlling viral infections. HIV-infected individuals develop CTL responses against epitopes derived from viral proteins, but also against cryptic epitopes encoded by viral alternative reading frames (ARF). We studied here the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape from CTLs targeting one such cryptic epitope, Q9VF, encoded by an HIVgag ARF and presented by HLA-B*07.

We studied here the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape from CTLs targeting one such cryptic epitope, Q9VF, encoded by an HIVgag ARF and presented by HLA-B*07. Using PBMCs of HIV-infected patients, we first cloned and sequenced proviral DNA encoding for Q9VF. We identified several polymorphisms with a minority of proviruses encoding at position 5 an aspartic acid (Q9VF/5D) and a majority encoding an asparagine (Q9VF/5N). We compared the prevalence of each variant in PBMCs of HLA-B*07+ and HLA-B*07patients.

Proviruses encoding Q9VF/5D were significantly less represented in HLA-B*07+ than in HLA-B*07patients, suggesting that Q9FV/5D encoding viruses might be under selective pressure in HLA-B*07+ individuals. We thus analyzed ex vivo CTL responses directed against Q9VF/5D and Q9VF/5N. Around 16% of HLA-B*07+ patients exhibited CTL responses targeting Q9VF epitopes.

The frequency and the magnitude of CTL responses induced with Q9VF/5D or Q9VF/5N peptides were almost equal indicating a possible cross-reactivity of the same CTLs on the two peptides. We then dissected the cellular mechanisms involved in the presentation of Q9VF variants. As expected, cells infected with HIV strains encoding for Q9VF/5D were recognized by Q9VF/5D-specific CTLs.

In contrast, Q9VF/5N-encoding strains were neither recognized by Q9VF/5Nnor by Q9VF/5D-specific CTLs. Using in vitro proteasomal digestions and MS/MS analysis, we demonstrate that the 5N variation introduces a strong proteasomal cleavage site within the epitope, leading to a dramatic reduction of Q9VF epitope production.

The C-terminal PPKTG sorting motif of CD2831 is cleaved between the threonine and glycine residues, and the carboxyl group of threonine is amide-linked to the side chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the peptidoglycan peptide stem.

Three cytokines; sFAS, IL-13 and IL-4 were reduced while seven; GM-CSF, IL-2, PDGF-BB, IL-8, KC, RANTES and TNF-a were elevated in mycobacteria-infected cats compared to healthy controls. However, IL-8 and KC concentrations were not significantly different from cats hospitalised for other reasons. Elevations in TNF-a and PDGF-BB may have potential to identify M. bovis and M.

Thus, IL-10+CD4+ T cells suppress antiviral immune responses against CMV.

The SNM rate is strongly positively correlated with the mutation rate for insertions and deletions between lines (r > 0.97).

We discovered and replicated 12 loci. This allowed us to demonstrate an overlap in genetic control between total plasma protein and IgG glycosylation. The majority of revealed loci contained genes that encode enzymes directly involved in glycosylation (FUT3/FUT6, FUT8, B3GAT1, ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, ST3GAL4, MGAT3 and MGAT5) and a known regulator of plasma protein fucosylation (HNF1A). However, we also found loci that could possibly reflect other more complex aspects of glycosylation process.

Abstract: Inflammation has been proposed as a major component of neurodegenerative diseases, although the precise role it plays has yet to be defined. We examined the role of key contributors to this inflammatory process, microglia, the major resident immune cell population of the brain, in a prion disease model of chronic neurodegeneration. Initially, we performed an extensive reanalysis of a large study of prion disease, where the transcriptome of mouse brains had been monitored throughout the time course of disease.

Our analysis has provided a detailed classification of the disease-associated genes based on cell type of origin and gene function.

Inertial focusing in spiral microchannels has been recognised as an attractive approach for high-throughput cell sorting for myriad point of care and clinical diagnostics. Particles of different sizes interact to a different degree with the fluid flow pattern generated within the spiral microchannel and that leads to particles ordering and separation based on size.

ct: During mammalian ontogenesis, the thymic "pure" endodermal epithelial anlage develops and differentiates into a complex cellular microenvironment. Beginning the 7-8th week of intrauterine development, thymic epithelial cells chemotactically regulate (induce) numerous waves of migration of stem cells into the thymus, including the CD34+, yolk sac-derived, committed hematopoietic stem cells.

egulate (induce) numerous waves of migration of stem cells into the thymus, including the CD34+, yolk sac-derived, committed hematopoietic stem cells. In vitro experiments have established that CD34+ CD38dim human thymocytes differentiate into T lymphocytes when co-cultured with mouse fetal thymic organs. Hematopoietic stem cells for myeloid and thymic stromal dendritic cells (DCs) are present within the minute population of CD34+ progenitors within the mammalian thymus.

cells for myeloid and thymic stromal dendritic cells (DCs) are present within the minute population of CD34+ progenitors within the mammalian thymus. The common myeloid, DC, natural killer (NK) and T lymphocyte progenitors have also been identified within the CD34+ stem cell population in the human thymus. Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems have been reported in various regions of the mammalian body including the anterior pituitary (AP), the skin, and the central (thymus) and peripheral lymphatic system.

Folliculo-stellate cells (FSC) in the AP, Langerhans cells (LCs) in the skin and lymphatic system, "veiled" cells, lympho-dendritic and interdigitating cells (IDCs) in a number of tissues comprising the lymphatic system are the cell types of the DC meshwork of "professional" antigen presenting cells (APCs). Most of these cells express the immunocytochemical markers S-100, CD1.

FSCs also express lymphatic DC markers, such as DC specific aminopeptidase, leucyl-beta-naphthylaminidase, non-specific esterase, MHC class I and II molecules and various other lymphatic immunological determinants [platelet derived growth factor-alpha chain (PDGF-alpha chain), CD13, CD14 and L25 antigen].

There is strong evidence that such DCs in the AP, and similar ones in the developing thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue are the components of a powerful "professional" antigen presenting DC network. These APCs contain a specialized late endocytic compartment, MIIC (MHC class II-enriched compartment), that harbors newly synthesized MHC class II antigens en route to the cell membrane.

There are a number of "molecular couples" that influence DC and T lymphocyte interaction during antigen presentation: CD/1/CD18 integrins, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), lymphocyte function associated antigen 3 (LFA-3). CD40, CD80/B7-1, CD86/B7-2, and heat-stable antigen.

The "molecular couples" are involved in adhesive or co-stimulatory regulations, mediating an effective binding of DCs to T lymphocytes and the stimulation of specific intercellular communications. DCs also provide all of the known co-stimulatory signals required for activation of unprimed T lymphocytes.

It has been shown that DCs initiate several immune responses, such as the sensitization of MHC-restricted T lymphocytes, resistance to infections and neoplasms, rejection of organ transplants, and the formation of T-dependent antibodies.

However, CD4-depletion using a monoclonal antibody was considered unsuccessful and relapsing MS responds well to B cell depletion via CD20 B cell depleting antibodies. The influence of CD20 B cell depletion in relapsing EAE was assessed.
